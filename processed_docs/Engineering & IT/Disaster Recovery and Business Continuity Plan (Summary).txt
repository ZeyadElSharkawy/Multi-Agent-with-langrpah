Disaster Recovery and Business 
Continuity Plan (Summary) 
Document ID: IE-DRP-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: IT & Engineering - Infrastructure 
1. Objective 
To ensure the continuity of critical business functions and rapid recovery of the SaaS platform 
following any major disruption (natural disaster, regional outage, cyber-attack). 
2. Key Recovery Metrics 
Metric 
Definition 
Target Time 
RPO (Recovery Point 
Objective) 
Maximum acceptable data 
loss (time between last 
consistent backup and 
failure). 
15 minutes (for core 
production data). 
RTO (Recovery Time 
Objective) 
Maximum acceptable time 
to restore critical business 
functions after a disaster is 
declared. 
4 hours (for core SaaS 
platform functionality). 
3. Recovery Strategy 
●​ Criticality: Tier 0 (Core AI Inference, API Gateway, Authentication) is prioritized. Tier 1 
(Analytics, secondary services) follows. 
●​ Data Backup: All production database data is backed up continuously (RPO 15 min) and 
replicated asynchronously to the designated DR Region (Europe). 
●​ Failover Mechanism: The Primary Region uses a Pilot Light strategy. In the event of 
primary failure, the DR region's standby compute resources can be scaled up and pointed 
to the replicated data to meet the RTO target. 
●​ Testing: Full disaster recovery simulation (failover to DR region and back) must be 
performed semi-annually. Results are reported to the CTO. 
4. Business Continuity (BC) 

●​ Personnel: The Remote Work Policy ensures continuity of operations as all staff are 
already distributed. 
●​ Vendors: Critical third-party vendors must have documented DR plans and be reviewed 
annually via the Vendor Due Diligence Form.
