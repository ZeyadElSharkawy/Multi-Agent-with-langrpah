Software Engineering Coding and 
Review Standards 
Document ID: IE-SCS-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: IT & Engineering - R&D 
1. Goal 
To ensure the delivery of high-quality, maintainable, secure, and performant code across all 
product teams. 
2. Code Quality and Style 
●​ Linting and Formatting: Automated linting (e.g., ESLint, Black, Prettier) must be 
enforced in the CI pipeline for all supported languages (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, 
Go). Code must conform to team-agreed style guides. 
●​ Comments and Documentation: All public APIs, classes, and complex functions must 
be documented with clear, concise inline comments and docstrings explaining purpose, 
parameters, and return values. 
●​ Readability: Code must be clear, simple, and self-documenting. Avoid excessive 
abstraction or premature optimization. 
3. Code Review (Pull Request) Process 
●​ Mandatory Review: All code merged to main (or a release branch) requires approval 
from a minimum of two qualified peers. 
●​ Review Focus: Reviewers must check for: 
○​ Functional correctness and test coverage. 
○​ Adherence to security best practices (OWASP Top 10). 
○​ Performance implications (e.g., N+1 query issues, complex loops). 
○​ Documentation updates (READMEs, API specs). 
●​ Size Limit: Pull Requests should be kept small (ideally < 300 lines of change) to facilitate 
effective review. 
4. Testing Requirements 
●​ Unit Test Coverage: Mandatory minimum of 80% code coverage for all new feature 
development and bug fixes, enforced in CI. 
●​ Integration Tests: Critical application flows must be covered by integration tests that run 
against the Staging environment. 
●​ Security Testing: All new endpoints must pass SAST/DAST (Static/Dynamic Analysis) 

scans run during the CI/CD pipeline. 
5. Handling Technical Debt 
Technical debt must be explicitly tracked in the backlog (e.g., JIRA). Teams must dedicate a 
minimum of 20% of each sprint to addressing critical technical debt and refactoring activities 
(per the Technical Debt Management Strategy).
