Data-at-Rest and Data-in-Transit 
Encryption Standard 
Document ID: IE-DES-2025.01 
Version: 1.0

Department: IT & Engineering - Security 
1. Goal 
To protect all NexaCore and client data from unauthorized access through the mandatory 
application of cryptographic controls. 
2. Data-in-Transit (DIT) 
●​ Mandatory Protocol: All communication entering or leaving NexaCore’s perimeter, and 
all internal service-to-service communication, must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or 
higher. 
●​ Cipher Suites: Only strong cipher suites (e.g., AES-256 with GCM) are permitted. Weak 
ciphers (e.g., RC4, 3DES) are strictly prohibited. 
●​ Client Connections: The SaaS platform API gateway must enforce HTTPS for all client 
connections. 
3. Data-at-Rest (DAR) 
●​ Storage Requirement: All data stored in persistence layers (databases, object storage, 
block storage, and backups) must be encrypted at rest. 
●​ Managed Keys: Encryption keys must be managed by the Cloud Provider's Key 
Management Service (KMS) or a NexaCore-controlled Hardware Security Module (HSM). 
Direct, unencrypted storage of cryptographic keys is prohibited. 
●​ Specific Data: Highly sensitive data (e.g., client authentication secrets, specific P-2 
data) must utilize application-level encryption, adding a layer of protection beyond 
standard disk encryption. 
4. Key Management 
●​ Rotation: Cryptographic keys used for production services must be automatically rotated 
on a schedule no longer than 90 days. 
●​ Access Control: Access to KMS/HSM is restricted via IAM and JIT principles, limited only 
to authorized engineers for deployment purposes.
