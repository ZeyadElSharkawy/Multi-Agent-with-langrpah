Vulnerability and Patch Management 
Policy 
Document ID: IE-VPP-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: IT & Engineering - Security 
1. Goal 
To systematically identify, assess, and remediate security vulnerabilities in all production 
systems, application code, and third-party dependencies. 
2. Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment 
●​ Automated Scanning: Continuous, automated scanning of cloud infrastructure (Cloud 
Security Posture Management - CSPM), container images, and application code 
(SAST/DAST) is mandatory. 
●​ Penetration Testing (Pen Test): An external, independent penetration test must be 
performed annually against the production environment. 
●​ Bug Bounty Program: A formalized bug bounty program will be maintained to engage 
external security researchers. 
3. Remediation Timeline (Service-Level Agreement) 
Vulnerabilities must be remediated according to their severity, prioritized using the Common 
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS): 
CVSS Score / Severity 
Remediation Deadline 
9.0 - 10.0 (Critical) 
7 days from discovery. 
7.0 - 8.9 (High) 
30 days from discovery. 
4.0 - 6.9 (Medium) 
90 days from discovery. 
0.1 - 3.9 (Low) 
Scheduled for the next quarter's technical 
debt sprint. 
4. Patch Management 
●​ Operating Systems & Infrastructure: Automated patching is enabled for non-critical 

infrastructure components. Manual patching for core OS kernels must occur within 14 
days of a stable security release. 
●​ Dependencies (Code): Library dependencies with Critical or High-severity CVEs must 
trigger an immediate CI/CD pipeline fix and fast-track deployment.
