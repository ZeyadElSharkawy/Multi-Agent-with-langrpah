CI/CD and DevOps Automation Standard 
Document ID: IE-DCS-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: IT & Engineering - DevOps 
1. Goal 
To enable high-frequency, reliable, and secure deployment of code and infrastructure 
changes with minimal human intervention. 
2. Continuous Integration (CI) Requirements 
●​ Version Control: All source code and IaC must reside in Git (private repositories). 
●​ Mandatory Testing: Every pull request (PR) must pass automated unit tests, integration 
tests, and static code analysis (SAST) checks before merging into the main branch. 
●​ Artifact Registry: Build outputs (Docker images, compiled binaries) must be immutably 
tagged and stored in a secure, audited container registry. 
●​ Dependency Scanning: Mandatory execution of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) 
to check for known vulnerabilities and license compliance (per the OSS Licensing 
Policy). 
3. Continuous Deployment (CD) Requirements 
●​ Environments: The standard deployment flow is Developer -> Staging -> Production. 
●​ Staging Environment: Must mirror Production infrastructure and data schema as closely 
as possible. All release candidates must undergo a full regression and performance test 
in Staging. 
●​ Gateways and Approval: Deployment to Production requires automated checks (e.g., 
test success, security scan pass) and mandatory manual approval from the Engineering 
Lead and a peer from a separate team. 
●​ Deployment Strategy: Prefer Canary Deployments or Blue/Green techniques to 
minimize downtime and facilitate rapid rollback. Direct in-place replacement is prohibited 
for critical services. 
●​ Rollback: All deployments must have a defined, tested, and automated rollback strategy 
that can be executed within 5 minutes. 
4. Automation and Tooling 
The use of configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef) is limited; preference is given 
to cloud-native orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, serverless functions) managed via IaC.
