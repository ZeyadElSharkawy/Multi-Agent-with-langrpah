ML Model Governance and Data Pipeline 
Policy (MLOps) 
Document ID: IE-MGP-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: IT & Engineering - R&D, Data Science 
1. Objective 
To ensure that all Machine Learning models are developed, trained, deployed, and monitored 
in a secure, ethical, and reproducible manner. 
2. Data Governance and Training Sets 
●​ Data Lineage: All training data sets must be versioned, immutably stored, and traceable 
back to their source (e.g., anonymized client data, licensed public data). 
●​ Privacy: Training data must adhere to the Global Data Privacy Policy, with mandatory 
anonymization or pseudonymization techniques applied before being used in the R&D 
pipeline. 
●​ Bias Detection: Before training commences, data sets must be scanned for 
demographic or input feature bias using approved bias detection tools. 
3. Model Lifecycle and Versioning 
●​ Experiment Tracking: All experiments must be logged, tracking parameters, metrics 
(accuracy, fairness), and the specific data version used. 
●​ Model Registry: Only approved models that have passed mandatory review (security, 
performance, bias testing) may be stored in the central model registry. Each model must 
have a unique, immutable version tag. 
●​ Deployment: Model deployment must follow the standard CI/CD process (via 
containerization) and is managed via the MLOps pipeline, separate from the core 
application code deployment. 
4. Monitoring and Drift Management 
●​ Inference Monitoring: All deployed models must be monitored in real-time for: 
○​ Performance Decay: Drop in prediction accuracy or F1 score. 
○​ Data Drift: Changes in the input feature distribution compared to the training data. 
○​ Bias Drift: Changes in prediction fairness metrics across different demographic 
groups. 
●​ Retraining: Automated alerting on drift or performance decay triggers an immediate 
Human-in-the-Loop review. If the threshold is breached, the model must be 

 
quarantined and an automated retraining pipeline initiated with fresh data.
