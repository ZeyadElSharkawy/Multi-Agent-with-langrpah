1. Cloud Provider and Strategy 
NexaCore utilizes a multi-cloud strategy with a primary focus on [Major Cloud Provider] for 
its AI/ML training workloads and primary SaaS hosting. All infrastructure is managed using 
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via Terraform/Pulumi. 
2. Global Architecture Model 
Our core platform utilizes a three-tier architecture, implemented across multiple geographic 
regions to serve our global client base and meet data localization requirements: 
Region Type 
Purpose 
Key Services 
Hosted 
Required 
Compliance 
Primary Region 
(Dubai/DIFC) 
Core R&D, primary 
API endpoint, 
central user 
authentication, 
core database. 
ML Training Cluster, 
Kubernetes Control 
Plane, Main 
Application API 
Gateway. 
UAE PDPL, 
Financial Services 
(DIFC). 
MENA PoP 
(KSA/Egypt) 
Regional 
Point-of-Presence 
(PoP) for data 
localization and 
low-latency client 
access. 
Regional Caching, 
Load Balancing, 
Data Shards 
(isolated customer 
data). 
KSA/Egypt Data 
Sovereignty Laws. 
DR Region 
(Europe) 
Disaster Recovery 
(DR) and cold 
backup site. 
Database backups, 
static asset 
storage, standby 
compute cluster. 
GDPR (as fallback). 

3. Core Principles 
●​ Scalability: All services must be deployed using containerization (Kubernetes) and 
auto-scaling groups. Fixed-size resources are prohibited for production workloads. 
●​ Cost Management: Utilize reserved instances and spot instances for non-critical, 
scalable compute (e.g., specific batch processing). Cost monitoring is mandatory via 
FinOps tools. 
●​ Network Isolation: Implement strict Zero Trust principles. All VPCs must be logically 
segmented, with no default routes between environments (Dev, Staging, Production). 
●​ Monitoring: Mandatory integration with the central System Monitoring and Alerting 
Standard.
