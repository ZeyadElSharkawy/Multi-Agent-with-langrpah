Technical Debt Management and 
Refactoring Strategy

1. Policy Statement 
Technical Debt (TD) is an accepted consequence of speed and innovation. However, 
unchecked TD leads to stagnation, security vulnerabilities, and high maintenance costs. 
NexaCore actively manages TD to prevent excessive accumulation. 
2. Classification of Technical Debt 
Classification 
Example 
Impact/Priority 
Critical Debt (P0/P1) 
Security vulnerabilities, 
unscalable architecture 
components, failing core 
dependency. 
Must be addressed 
immediately (within the 
current sprint). 
Strategic Debt (P2) 
Outdated libraries, complex 
codebase hindering new 
features, low test coverage. 
Scheduled as part of the 
mandatory 20% 
refactoring time in future 
sprints. 
Minor Debt (P3) 
Non-standard coding style, 
poor documentation, minor 
duplication. 
Addressed 
opportunistically during 
feature development. 
3. Debt Allocation Strategy 
●​ Dedicated Time: All engineering teams must dedicate a minimum of 20% of their total 
sprint capacity to TD remediation. This time is mandatory and cannot be sacrificed for 
feature work without CTO approval. 
●​ Tracking: TD must be explicitly recorded in the project management backlog (JIRA) with 
a clear description, impact assessment, and estimated cost to fix. 
●​ Architecture Review Board (ARB): The ARB reviews all major design decisions to 
minimize the creation of new high-impact debt and evaluates the priority of existing 

strategic debt quarterly. 
4. Debt Amortization 
The goal is to amortize the debt over time, ensuring the net amount of new TD created per 
quarter is less than the amount of existing TD resolved. The health of the codebase is a key 
metric in the annual performance review of Engineering Managers.
