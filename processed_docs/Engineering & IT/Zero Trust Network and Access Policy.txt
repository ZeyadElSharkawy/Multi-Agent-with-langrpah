Zero Trust Network and Access Policy 
Document ID: IE-ZTP-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: IT & Engineering - Security 
1. Core Principle 
Never Trust, Always Verify. Access is not granted based on location (internal network), but 
on the authenticated identity of the user or service and the assessed security posture of the 
device. 
2. Identity and Access Management (IAM) 
●​ Central Identity: All access (applications, infrastructure, cloud console) must be 
managed via the central Identity Provider (IdP). 
●​ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA is mandatory for all employees, contractors, 
and service accounts accessing NexaCore’s production environment or sensitive data 
(P-1, P-2 data). 
●​ Least Privilege: Access rights must be scoped to the minimum required for the function 
(Just-in-Time, or JIT, access is preferred) and reviewed quarterly. 
3. Network Segmentation and Micro-segmentation 
●​ Network Level: All cloud VPCs and subnets are considered untrusted. Firewalls default 
to DENY. 
●​ Service Level (Micro-segmentation): Services within Kubernetes must communicate 
only via encrypted, authenticated connections (mTLS). Ingress/Egress rules must 
explicitly define permitted service-to-service communication. 
●​ Remote Access: Direct VPN access to the corporate network is phased out. Remote 
access to critical resources must be done via a secure gateway that verifies device health 
(antivirus, patch level) before granting JIT access. 
4. Monitoring and Logging 
All access attempts, policy violations, and network flows must be logged to a central, 
tamper-proof security information and event management (SIEM) system. Automated alerts 
must be configured for all suspicious access patterns.
