1. Objective 
To provide real-time visibility into the health, performance, and security of the entire platform 
and ensure timely, actionable alerting for on-call teams. 
2. Pillars of Monitoring 
●​ Logs: Centralized logging solution required for all application, infrastructure, and security 
logs (SIEM). Logs must be retained for a minimum of 90 days for troubleshooting. 
●​ Metrics: Continuous collection of system metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk) and application 
metrics (latency, error rates, throughput) via Prometheus/Grafana or equivalent tool. 
●​ Traces: Mandatory distributed tracing for all microservices to enable root cause analysis 
of complex, multi-service requests. 
3. Alerting Philosophy 
Alerts must be actionable, specific, and routed to the correct On-Call Team. 
●​ Thresholds: Alerts must be based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs), focusing on the 
customer experience (e.g., Latency degradation, Error Rate spike) rather than purely 
resource utilization (e.g., CPU > 90%). 
●​ Routing: Alerts are routed through an automated incident response tool that follows the 
Technical Incident Management Protocol for escalation (P0/P1 alerts must page the 
On-Call Lead). 
●​ Silence/Deduplication: Noise is minimized through smart deduplication and pre-defined 
silence windows for planned maintenance. 
4. Health Checks 
All services must expose standard, unauthenticated /health or /metrics endpoints used by 
load balancers and Kubernetes for readiness and liveness probes.
