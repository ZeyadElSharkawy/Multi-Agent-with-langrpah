relevant team. 
3. Incident Lifecycle 
1.​ Detection: Triggered by automated monitoring (P0, P1) or direct user report (P2, P3). 
2.​ Triage & Declaration: On-Call Lead validates the impact, assigns severity, and declares 
the incident. 
3.​ Communication: Internal communication is initiated via dedicated incident channel 
(Slack). External communication (for P0/P1) follows the Data Breach Incident Response 
Plan (if applicable). 
4.​ Remediation: Incident Commander directs technical team efforts (triage, diagnosis, 
fix/rollback). 
5.​ Resolution: Service returns to normal. 
6.​ Post-Mortem: Mandatory for all P0 and P1 incidents. 
4. Post-Mortem Requirement 
A full Post-Mortem document must be completed within 48 hours of resolution. It must be 
blameless, focusing on system and process failures, and include concrete, tracked action 
items to prevent recurrence.
