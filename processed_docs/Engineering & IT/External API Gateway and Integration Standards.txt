External API Gateway and Integration 
Standards 
Document ID: IE-APS-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: IT & Engineering - R&D 
1. Objective 
To define the requirements for all externally exposed APIs to ensure security, high 
performance, version control, and clear documentation for clients. 
2. API Design and Documentation 
●​ RESTful Standard: All APIs must follow a consistent, RESTful design approach, using 
standard HTTP methods and status codes. 
●​ Versioning: All major API changes require a new version number (e.g., /v2/). Older 
versions must be supported for a minimum of 12 months after the release of a new major 
version, with clear deprecation warnings. 
●​ Documentation: All APIs must be documented using an industry-standard specification 
(e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) and publicly hosted on the developer portal. 
3. Security and Authentication 
●​ Authentication: All external API endpoints require strong, token-based authentication 
(e.g., OAuth 2.0 or secure API keys). Basic authentication is prohibited. 
●​ Rate Limiting: Mandatory rate limiting must be configured at the API Gateway to protect 
against DoS attacks and ensure fair usage across all clients. Standard limit: [1000 
requests per minute] per client key. 
●​ Input Validation: Strict server-side validation and sanitization of all input parameters is 
required to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQLi, XSS). 
4. Performance and Data Handling 
●​ Latency: The target median API latency (P50) is < 100 milliseconds. 
●​ Payloads: Payloads must be efficient (JSON format, gzip compression encouraged). 
Sensitive data returned in API responses must be minimal and encrypted in transit (per 
Data Encryption Standard).
