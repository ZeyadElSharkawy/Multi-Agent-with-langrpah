Global Remote and Hybrid Work Policy 
Document ID: HR-RWP-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-08-01 
Department: Human Resources & Operations 
1. Introduction 
NexaCore Solutions supports flexible work arrangements to promote productivity, work-life 
balance, and talent retention. This policy outlines the conditions for hybrid and fully remote 
work. 
2. Definitions and Eligibility 
●​ Hybrid Work: Employees based in the Dubai HQ who split their time between the office 
and a designated home location. The minimum in-office attendance is 2 days per 
week. 
●​ Fully Remote Work: Employees who work primarily from an approved location outside 
the HQ, typically in other MENA regional offices or jurisdictions. Fully remote status 
requires explicit approval from the Department Head and HR. 
●​ Eligibility: Determined by role suitability (e.g., roles requiring specialized on-site 
hardware or constant in-person client interaction may not be eligible). Employees must 
be in good standing (no active performance or disciplinary issues). 
3. Expectations for Remote/Hybrid Employees 
3.1. Availability and Communication 
Remote employees must be available during core business hours: [10:00 AM to 4:00 PM] 
GST. Communication must be prompt, professional, and conducted via approved channels 
(Slack, Email, Google Meet). Managers must establish clear, frequent check-in schedules. 
3.2. Workspace and IT Security 
●​ Ergonomics: Employees are responsible for maintaining a safe, ergonomic workspace at 
home. 
●​ Security: All company data must be accessed only via company-issued hardware and 
the mandatory VPN connection. Confidential documents must not be printed or left 
unsecured (refer to the IT Security Policy). 
3.3. Performance Management 
Performance standards are the same for all employees, regardless of location. Output, quality, 
and adherence to deadlines are the primary measures. Managers will use digital metrics (e.g., 

project completion in Jira, ticket resolution time) for objective assessment. 
4. Termination of Arrangement 
The remote/hybrid work arrangement is a privilege, not a right, and can be reviewed or 
terminated at any time by NexaCore management based on: 
●​ Decline in performance. 
●​ Violation of security or company policies. 
●​ Changing business requirements that necessitate on-site presence.
