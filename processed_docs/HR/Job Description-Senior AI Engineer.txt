Summary 
The Senior AI Engineer will be responsible for the design, development, and deployment of 
cutting-edge machine learning models and algorithms that power NexaCore's core 
automation platform. This role requires deep expertise in MLOps, scalable cloud 
infrastructure, and the ability to translate complex business problems into high-performing, 
reliable AI solutions for our enterprise clients. 
Key Responsibilities 
1.​ AI/ML Model Development: 
○​ Design, implement, and optimize scalable, production-ready AI models (e.g., NLP, 
predictive analytics, computer vision) to solve enterprise workflow challenges. 
○​ Ensure models are trained, validated, and deployed with high accuracy and low 
latency. 
2.​ Infrastructure & MLOps: 
○​ Collaborate with DevOps to build and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines for ML models 
(MLOps). 
○​ Manage model versioning, monitoring, and retraining loops on our cloud platform 
([AWS/Azure/GCP]). 
3.​ Research & Innovation: 
○​ Stay current with the latest advancements in AI and emerging tech, proposing 
internal proofs-of-concept (PoCs) that align with NexaCore’s product roadmap. 
○​ Act as a technical mentor to junior engineers. 
4.​ Security & Compliance: 
○​ Implement data governance and security best practices for all data utilized in model 
training, adhering to regional and international data privacy laws. 
Required Qualifications 
●​ Master's Degree in Computer Science, AI, or a related quantitative field. 
●​ 5+ years of experience in software development, with at least 3 years focused on 
production-level ML engineering. 
●​ Expertise in Python and common ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn). 
●​ Proven experience deploying and managing ML models in a cloud environment (e.g., 
Azure ML, Sagemaker). 

●​ Strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, and distributed systems. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
●​ Model latency and throughput (e.g., 99th percentile response time). 
●​ Model accuracy (e.g., F1-score, AUC) in production. 
●​ Adherence to deployment schedule (time-to-market for new features). 
●​ Reduction in model-related incidents/bugs post-release.
