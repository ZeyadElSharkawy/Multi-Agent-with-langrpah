1. Executive Summary 
FY2025 was a period of aggressive expansion, aligned with the launch of our new AI Workflow 
Suite. Headcount grew by [35%], primarily in Engineering and Sales. Key challenges include

workforce. Core successes include a 20% reduction in average time-to-hire for technical roles 
and the successful rollout of the new global HRIS platform.

enhanced equity grants to stabilize critical mid-career technical talent. 
2.​ Culture: Initiate a "Hybrid Work Effectiveness" survey to refine the Remote Work Policy 
and improve team cohesion across geographical boundaries. 
3.​ Hiring: Expand the talent pool to include non-traditional educational backgrounds to 
address the demand for specialized AI skills.
