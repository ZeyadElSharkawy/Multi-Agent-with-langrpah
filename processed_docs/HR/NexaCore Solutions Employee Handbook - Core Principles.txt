3. Employment Basics 

3.1. Contract of Employment 
Every employee is issued a formal employment contract detailing role, compensation, 
benefits, and local labor law provisions (UAE Law where applicable). 
3.2. Work Hours and Attendance 
The standard work week is [40] hours. While we embrace a flexible working environment (see 
Remote Work Policy), employees are expected to be available during core hours: [10:00 AM 
to 4:00 PM] GST (Gulf Standard Time), unless otherwise agreed upon with the direct 
manager. Consistent punctuality for meetings and adherence to project deadlines is 
mandatory. 
4. Dress Code 
NexaCore maintains a Smart-Casual dress code. Professional attire is required for client 
meetings, industry events, or when representing the company publicly. Comfort and 
cleanliness are key, but overly casual attire (e.g., shorts, flip-flops) is discouraged in the office. 
5. Information Security and Confidentiality 
Given our focus on enterprise SaaS and proprietary AI algorithms, the protection of client 
data, internal trade secrets, and intellectual property is paramount. All employees must 
complete mandatory annual IT Security training. Unauthorized disclosure of any 
confidential information will result in immediate disciplinary action, up to and including 
termination.
