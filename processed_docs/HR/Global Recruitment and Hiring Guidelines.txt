1. Introduction 
This document establishes the standard procedure for attracting, assessing, and hiring top 
talent globally, with a focus on roles critical to NexaCore’s AI and SaaS product delivery. 
2. The Hiring Process Flow 
Step 1: Needs Assessment and Authorization (Manager/HR) 
●​ The hiring manager completes a Requisition Form detailing the role's justification, core 
responsibilities, and necessary budget. 
●​ The form must be approved by the Department Head and the Head of Finance. 
●​ HR finalizes the Job Description (JD), ensuring alignment with the required technical 
skills and NexaCore’s mission. 
Step 2: Sourcing and Advertising (HR/Manager) 
●​ HR determines the sourcing strategy: internal mobility, online job boards, specialized 
AI/Tech recruitment agencies, or regional career fairs. 
●​ All job advertisements must be inclusive, non-discriminatory, and clearly articulate 
NexaCore's core values. 
Step 3: Candidate Screening (HR/Manager) 
●​ HR Screening: Initial review of applications for basic qualifications, cultural fit, and salary 
expectations. 
●​ Manager/Technical Screening: Deeper dive into technical competencies, previous 
project success, and relevance to the SaaS industry. 
Step 4: Interview Process 
A structured interview process is mandatory to ensure fairness and consistency: 
1.​ Stage 1 (Behavioral): Focused on cultural fit, work ethic, and alignment with NexaCore 
values. 
2.​ Stage 2 (Technical/Functional): Skills assessment, live coding (for Engineers), or case 
studies (for Sales/Product). AI-centric roles must include a competency task. 

3.​ Stage 3 (Leadership/Final): Interview with a Department Head or C-Level Executive. 
Step 5: Offer and Onboarding 
●​ HR verifies references and conducts necessary background checks. 
●​ The hiring manager and HR determine the final compensation offer based on internal 
equity and market rates. 
●​ HR extends a formal, written Offer of Employment. 
●​ Once accepted, the new hire is moved into the Onboarding Checklist process. 
3. Interview Best Practices 
●​ Consistency: All candidates for the same role must be asked the same core set of 
questions. 
●​ Focus on Impact: Questions should focus on past results and measurable contributions, 
not just tasks performed. 
●​ Avoid Bias: Interviewers must be trained to recognize and mitigate unconscious bias. 
Hiring decisions must be documented and merit-based.
