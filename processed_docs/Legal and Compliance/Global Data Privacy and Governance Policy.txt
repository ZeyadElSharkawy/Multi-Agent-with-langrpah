Global Data Privacy and Governance 
Policy 
Document ID: LC-DPP-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: Legal & Compliance, IT Security 
1. Scope and Applicable Laws 
This policy applies to all NexaCore personnel and covers all personal data (PD) collected, 
processed, and stored globally. We adhere to the stricter of the applicable standards, 
including but not limited to: 
●​ EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
●​ UAE Federal Decree Law No. 45/2021 (PDPL) 
●​ Specific regulatory requirements in KSA and Egypt (e.g., data localization, foreign data 
transfer). 
2. Key Data Principles 
Principle 
Definition 
Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency 
Data processing must have a clear legal 
basis, be transparent to the data subject, 
and be done fairly. 
Purpose Limitation 
Data is collected for specified, explicit, and 
legitimate purposes and not further 
processed in a manner incompatible with 
those purposes. 
Data Minimization 
Only PD that is adequate, relevant, and 
limited to what is necessary for the 
purposes of processing shall be 
processed. 
Accuracy 
PD must be accurate and, where 
necessary, kept up to date. 
Storage Limitation 
PD must be kept for no longer than is 
necessary for the purposes for which the 
PD is processed (see Data Retention 

Schedule). 
Integrity and Confidentiality 
PD must be processed securely, protected 
against unauthorized access, and 
accidental loss or destruction. 
3. Regional Data Localization Requirements (MENA) 
●​ UAE (PDPL): PD can generally be transferred outside the UAE provided the destination 
country ensures an adequate level of protection, or adequate safeguards are in place 
(e.g., specific contractual clauses). 
●​ KSA and Egypt: Specific client contracts and regulatory instructions may mandate 
certain sensitive data (e.g., government data, financial data) be hosted only within the 
national borders. The Product team must use regional server clusters to comply with 
these requirements. 
4. Data Subject Rights 
NexaCore must have mechanisms to respond to Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs), 
including the right to access, rectify, erase ("right to be forgotten"), and restrict processing of 
their PD. All DSARs must be routed to the Compliance Officer within [48 hours] of receipt.
