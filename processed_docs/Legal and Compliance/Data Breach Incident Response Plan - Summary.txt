3. Four Phases of Response 
Phase 1: Detection and Containment (Immediate) 
●​ Action: Technical Lead isolates affected systems (e.g., disconnecting network segments, 
changing compromised credentials). 
●​ Goal: Stop the breach and prevent further data loss or system damage. 
●​ Notification: IC notifies IRT members immediately. 
Phase 2: Assessment and Eradication (0-48 Hours) 
●​ Action: Forensic analysis to determine the root cause, scope (what data was affected, 
whose data), and severity. 
●​ Goal: Fully understand the incident, remove the threat, and restore affected systems. 
●​ Legal Input: Legal Counsel assesses regulatory notification obligations (e.g., within 72 
hours under GDPR/PDPL). 

Phase 3: Notification and Communication 
●​ Action: Communication Lead prepares internal and external statements. Legal Counsel 
manages mandatory notifications to regulatory authorities (e.g., Dubai Regulator) and 
affected data subjects (clients/employees). 
●​ Rule: All external communication must be vetted and approved by Legal Counsel and the 
CEO. No public statements are permitted without approval. 
Phase 4: Post-Incident Review 
●​ Action: IRT conducts a "lessons learned" review, updates security policies and controls, 
and documents the full incident lifecycle for audit purposes.
