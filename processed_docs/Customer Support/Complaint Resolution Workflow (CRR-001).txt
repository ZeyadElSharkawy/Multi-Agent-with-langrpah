Complaint Resolution Workflow 
(CRR-001) 
Department: Customer Support & Success 
Objective: Provide a standardized, transparent process for handling and resolving 
high-severity customer complaints that threaten retention or brand image. 
Phase 1: Triage and Registration (L1 Agent) 
1.​ Identification: L1 Agent identifies the ticket as a formal complaint (usually marked by 
frustration, threats of contract termination, or repeated unresolved P2/P3 issues). 
2.​ Registration: Register the complaint in the CRM system under the "Retention Risk" tag 
and assign a Complaint Reference Number (CRN). 
3.​ Acknowledgement: Send a personalized (non-templated) email to the client within 1 
hour acknowledging the complaint, assuring them that a dedicated manager will take 
over. 
Phase 2: Dedicated Manager Ownership (L2/CSM) 
1.​ Transfer: The ticket is immediately transferred to a dedicated L2 Specialist or the 
assigned Customer Success Manager (CSM). 
2.​ Internal Review (The 3 Whys): The owner conducts an internal review of the ticket 
history and asks: 
○​ Why did the issue occur? (Root Cause) 
○​ Why was the previous resolution inadequate? (Process Failure) 
○​ Why did the client feel the need to complain formally? (Communication/Empathy 
Failure) 
3.​ Contact: The owner contacts the client via phone call within 4 hours of ownership to 
verbally apologize, confirm understanding of the issue, and set expectations for the 
resolution plan. 
Phase 3: Resolution and Internal Correction 
1.​ Action Plan: The owner generates a concise, internal Action Plan detailing the steps 
(technical fix, process change, or credit offer) needed to satisfy the client. 
2.​ Execution: Technical fixes are prioritized by R&D/SRE (treated as a high-P2 issue). 
3.​ Confirmation: Once the technical fix is deployed, the owner confirms resolution with the 
client and seeks formal written sign-off ("Resolution Confirmed"). 
Phase 4: Post-Mortem and Prevention 
1.​ Root Cause Analysis (RCA): The owner documents the full RCA, focusing on the 
process failures (Phase 2, Question 2). 
2.​ Knowledge Base Update: If the issue was due to lack of information, a new KB article or 

internal training must be created. 
3.​ Process Improvement: The RCA is shared with the Head of Support to identify systemic 
issues and prevent future recurrence of the same failure type.
