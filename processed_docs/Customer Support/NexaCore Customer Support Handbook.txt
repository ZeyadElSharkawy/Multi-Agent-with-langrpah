To serve as the seamless extension of the NexaCore platform, providing rapid, accurate, and 
empathetic technical assistance that enables our enterprise clients to maximize the value of 
their AI automation workflows. 
1.2 Core Support Principles 
●​ Enterprise Empathy: Always understand the significant business impact of every issue. 
A P1 incident for a client is a critical service disruption. 
●​ Technical Authority: Become deep experts in our core technology (Workflow Engine, 
API Gateway, AI Models). If you cannot solve it, you must know exactly who can. 
●​ Proactive Resolution: Anticipate client needs. Don't just close the ticket; confirm the 
root cause is fixed and provide documentation to prevent recurrence. 
●​ Multilingual Competence: Serve our MENA clients with professionalism in both English 
and Arabic, understanding local business context.

aids (screenshots/code blocks). Avoid informal language.
