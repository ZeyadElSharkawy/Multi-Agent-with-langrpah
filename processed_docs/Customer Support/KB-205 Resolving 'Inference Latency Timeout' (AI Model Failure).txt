KB-205: Resolving 'Inference Latency 
Timeout' (AI Model Failure) 
Applicable Product: Predictive AI Workflow Trigger (PAWT) 
Target Audience: Workflow Creators / L2 Technical Specialists 
Last Updated: 2025-11-05 
Problem Description 
You have received a workflow execution failure with the error message: [ERROR_CODE: 
AI-LT-504] Inference Latency Timeout: Model NexaCore-TSM v1.2 exceeded P99 threshold of 
500ms. 
This means the AI Model responsible for generating a prediction took too long to return a 
result, causing the downstream workflow step to fail. 
Possible Causes and Resolution 
Cause 1: High Input Payload Volume (Most Common) 
If your workflow is passing extremely large data packets (e.g., payloads ) to the AI service, it 
can strain the inference engine, leading to latency. 
●​ Resolution: Implement a pre-processing step using the Data Transformer block. 
Summarize or extract only the essential features required for the AI model before passing 
the data to the prediction block. 
Cause 2: Regional Network Congestion 
If the client's API Gateway is geographically distant from the AI inference cluster (e.g., 
accessing the Dubai AI cluster from an African regional node), network latency can contribute 
to the timeout. 
●​ Resolution (L2 Only): Check the current System Health Dashboard for high-latency 
alerts between the client's region and the main AI cluster. If congestion is confirmed, 
escalate as a P1 incident to SRE for potential traffic routing adjustments. 
Cause 3: Model Degradation / Out-of-Date Cache 
The model cache might be stale, forcing a slow disk read, or the model itself may be 
degrading under load. 
●​ Resolution (L3 R&D Only): L3 Engineering must check the AI Model Validation Report 
for the latest performance metrics. If performance is below the target, L3 must execute a 
manual model cache refresh or a full retraining cycle.
