Chatbot Script Samples (L0 Diagnostics) 
Platform: NexaCore In-App Assistant (Powered by Gemini) 
Objective: Resolve L0 (low-complexity) issues and efficiently triage/collect data for L1 
escalation. 
Script 1: Workflow Status Check (Pre-Escalation) 
User Input: "My expense approval workflow (ID: 789) hasn't executed for 3 hours." 
Chatbot Response (L0): 
Hello! I can certainly help check the status of Workflow ID 789. 
First, let's confirm the core issue: 
1.​ Is the workflow currently stuck (In Progress, but not moving)? 
2.​ Did the workflow fail with an error message? 
3.​ Did the workflow fail to start at all (Trigger not activating)? 
User selects: 3. Did the workflow fail to start at all. 
Chatbot Response (L0): 
Thank you. That usually points to a trigger configuration issue. Before connecting you to an L1 
agent, could you please confirm the following: 
●​ Is the workflow trigger based on a Scheduled Time or an API Event? 
●​ Have you checked the API Key status for the connecting service in the Integrations 
section? 
If user confirms they checked the API Key: 
Chatbot Response (L0): 
I see. I have logged these diagnostic steps. I am now opening a P2 ticket for you: [TICKET_ID]. 
I have automatically attached your workflow ID and the confirmed check of the API key status. 
An L1 specialist will take over shortly. 
Script 2: General Information/Documentation Request 
User Input: "Where can I find the documentation for the new AI content summarization 
block?" 
Chatbot Response (L0): 
I'd be happy to point you to the correct resource! The documentation for the AI Content 
Summarization Block is part of our Proactive Intelligence Module. 
Here are the direct links: 
●​ [Link: KB-201 - AI Summarization Block Setup Guide] 
●​ [Link: Feature Specification Document (PRD)] 
Is there anything else I can assist you with, or would you like me to connect you to a live agent 

for a specific technical question?
