1. Data Security and Privacy 
Q: Is my data used to train the global NexaCore AI models? 
A: No. Your client data is only used to fine-tune your specific private instance of our model 
(tenant-level isolation). Data is securely encrypted and stored according to our strict regional 
data residency policies. We do not use client data to train general, public models. 
Q: Where is my data physically stored? 
A: If you are an Enterprise client in the MENA region, your data is stored on regional servers 
located in the UAE/KSA, as required by your service agreement. This is guaranteed by our data 
residency compliance policy. 
2. AI Model Performance 
Q: My AI model is giving inaccurate predictions. What should I do? 
A: This is usually due to Data Drift. The model was trained on historical data, but your 
operational patterns have changed (e.g., a major seasonal shift in volume). 
1.​ Check the Model Health Dashboard for a "Low Confidence" warning. 
2.​ If confirmed, submit a P2 ticket with the model ID and request a Re-Training with the 
latest 6 months of your data. 
Q: How often is the model retrained? 
A: By default, all enterprise models are set for an automated quarterly re-training cycle. 
However, you can request an ad-hoc re-train if you notice sustained performance 
degradation. 
3. Billing and Usage 
Q: Why did my bill increase after activating the Predictive AI 
Workflow Trigger (PAWT)? 
A: The PAWT feature is part of our Premium Subscription Tier. Billing is based on the number 
of inference calls the model makes per month, not the number of successful workflow 

triggers. You can monitor your current call volume in the Billing Portal dashboard.
