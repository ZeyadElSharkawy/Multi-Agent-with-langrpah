Incident Management Protocol for P0/P1 
1.​ Initial Alert (L1): Within 5 minutes of confirmation, the L1 agent must post the issue and 
the client's Tenant ID into the relevant Slack channel (e.g., #ops-p0-alert). 
2.​ Acknowledgement (L3): The PagerDuty-alerted L3 engineer must acknowledge the 
incident within the SLA window and confirm the lead engineer on the issue. 
3.​ Executive Notification: The Head of Support must notify the VP of Operations and the 
Head of R&D for P0 incidents immediately via internal chat/phone, regardless of the time 
of day.
