2. Escalation Workflow (L1 to L3) 
P0 and P1 Escalation (Critical/High) 
1.​ L1 Action: Agent must confirm the P0/P1 status and create an internal Incident Report 
Form within 5 minutes of receiving the ticket. 
2.​ L1 Escalation: Immediately notify the L2 Technical Specialist via phone/dedicated 
PagerDuty channel. Do NOT rely on standard ticket assignment. 
3.​ L2 Action: L2 confirms the severity and immediately escalates the ticket to the relevant 
R&D/SRE On-Call Engineer (L3) via the official incident management system. 
4.​ L3 Action: The L3 Engineer takes ownership, starts Root Cause Analysis (RCA), and 
begins working on a hotfix. 
P2 and P3 Escalation (Medium/Low) 
1.​ L1 Action: Agent attempts to resolve the issue for 30 minutes. If no progress is made, the 
L1 Specialist documents all troubleshooting steps taken. 
2.​ L1 Escalation: The ticket is internally tagged as Escalate-L2 and assigned to the L2 
queue. 
3.​ L2 Action: L2 takes ownership and has 2 working days to resolve or hand off to L3 (R&D) 
if a code fix or database modification is required. 
4.​ Ownership Rule: Once escalated to L3 (R&D), the L2 Specialist remains the primary 
client communicator to ensure consistent messaging. 
3. Communication Protocol 
For P0/P1 incidents, the Head of Customer Support or Customer Success Manager (CSM) 
must send a 2-hour update to the client until the issue is resolved, providing status and 
estimated time of resolution (ETR).
