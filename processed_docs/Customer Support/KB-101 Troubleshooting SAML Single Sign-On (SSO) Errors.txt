Introduction 
SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) is critical for enterprise user provisioning. This guide assists your 
Identity Management team in troubleshooting common errors encountered when configuring 
the NexaCore Service Provider (SP) with your Identity Provider (IdP) (e.g., Azure AD, Okta). 
Section 1: Common Error Codes and Fixes 
If a user receives a generic error during login, consult the corresponding error code in the 
NexaCore Audit Logs. 
Error Code 
Description 
Root Cause / 
Recommended Fix 
SAML-403 
Unmatched Identity 
The NameID attribute being 
sent by your IdP does not 
match a known user email 
or ID in NexaCore's user 
database. Fix: Ensure the 
attribute mapping in your 
IdP is correctly sending the 
user's primary email 
address as the NameID. 
SAML-501 
Expired Certificate 
The signing certificate from 
your IdP has expired or was 
not updated in the 
NexaCore Enterprise 
Console before expiration. 
SAML-400 
Invalid Assertion 
The SAML Assertion is not 
correctly signed or 
encrypted. 
SAML-404 
No Role Mapping 
The user attempted to log 

in, but no corresponding 
NexaCore role could be 
found based on the 
provided group attributes. 
Section 2: How to Access SAML Audit Logs 
1.​ Log in to the NexaCore Enterprise Console as a System Administrator. 
2.​ Navigate to Settings Identity Management SSO Configuration. 
3.​ Click the "View SAML Audit Logs" button. 
4.​ Filter the logs by the failed user's email address and the time of the failed login attempt. 
This log provides the raw assertion data for diagnosis. 
⚠️ ATTENTION: If you are unable to resolve the SAML-501 error, contact your 
dedicated Customer Success Manager (CSM) or submit a P2 ticket with your new 
IdP metadata XML file attached.
