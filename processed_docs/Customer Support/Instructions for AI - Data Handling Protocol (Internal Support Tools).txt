Instructions for AI - Data Handling 
Protocol (Internal Support Tools) 
AI Tool: Gemini-Powered Support Assistant (Internal) 
Audience: L1/L2 Support Agents 
Objective: Define security and privacy protocols when interacting with client data via the 
internal AI assistant. 
Protocol: Client Ticket Summarization 
The internal Support Assistant is used to quickly summarize long ticket threads, analyze log 
snippets, and draft resolution emails. 
1. Mandatory Data Masking (CRITICAL) 
When providing a client log snippet or workflow details to the AI Assistant, you MUST ensure 
the following Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and highly sensitive enterprise data points 
are masked or replaced with placeholders: 
Data Type 
Example of Masking 
Client PII (User Level) 
Replace real names/emails with [USER_A], 
[USER_B], [EMAIL_MASKED]. 
API Keys / Secrets 
Replace with [API_KEY_MASKED]. Never 
input full keys. 
Financial Values 
Replace specific dollar amounts with 
[FIN_VALUE]. 
Private IP Addresses 
Replace internal IPs with [IP_MASKED]. 
Rationale: This practice ensures compliance with internal Data Privacy Policy, preventing 
highly sensitive client data from entering the large language model's context window. 
2. AI Prompting Guidelines 
When asking the AI to analyze a ticket, always include the following contextual constraints: 
1.​ Role Definition: Start with: "Act as a NexaCore L2 Support Specialist." 
2.​ Goal: State the precise action: "Analyze the attached log and determine the most likely 
root cause." 
3.​ Output Format: Specify the output: "Provide a 3-point bulleted summary. Do not use 

external sources." 
3. Verification of AI-Generated Content 
●​ Drafted Resolutions: If the AI Assistant drafts a resolution or RCA for you, you MUST 
review it for technical accuracy before sending it to the client. 
●​ Compliance Check: Agents are responsible for the final output. If the AI provides 
unmasked sensitive data, the agent must correct it and report the prompt failure to the 
Head of Support.
