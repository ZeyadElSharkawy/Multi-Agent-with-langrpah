Support Agent Training Module: 
Handling Enterprise AI Failures 
Module: Advanced Technical Support (L2 Focus) 
Duration: 90 Minutes 
Objective: Equip L2 agents to diagnose and communicate effectively during failures of 
AI/ML-driven features. 
Section 1: Understanding AI Failures 
AI issues rarely mean "the code broke"; they often mean the prediction was wrong. 
●​ Technical Failure: A microservice outage, API latency, or a database connection failure. 
(Handled by SRE/R&D - P0/P1) 
●​ Model Failure (Drift): The model is running, but the data it sees now is statistically 
different from its training data, leading to poor performance (inaccuracy). (Handled by 
Data Science/L2 - P2) 
●​ Configuration Failure: The user fed the wrong data types or formats to the AI block in 
the workflow. (Handled by L1/L2 - P3/P2) 
Section 2: L2 Diagnostic Checklist (AI-LT-504 Errors) 
When receiving an AI latency or timeout error, follow this checklist before escalating to R&D: 
Step 
Action 
Rationale 
1. Verify Input Payload 
Size 
Use the internal logger to 
check the size of the data 
packet passed to the AI 
block. 
Payloads cause timeouts. 
Advise client to 
pre-process data. 
2. Check Model Health 
Dashboard 
Look up the specific Model 
ID (e.g., NexaCore-TSM 
v1.2) in the R&D Model 
Dashboard. 
Check the Confidence 
Score and Data Drift 
warning. If low, model 
re-train is needed. 
3. Test with Known Good 
Data 
Run the client's workflow 
with a small, pre-approved 
"clean" test data set. 
If the clean data works, the 
client's current input data 
is the problem (Go back to 
Configuration). 
4. Regional Latency

involving SRE. 
Section 3: Communication - Setting Expectations 
●​ Avoid: "The AI is broken." 
●​ Use: "There appears to be a prediction confidence deviation in your customized model 
instance." 
●​ Expectation Setting: Model re-training is not an instant fix. Inform the client that a 
re-train cycle typically takes and will require additional configuration testing.
