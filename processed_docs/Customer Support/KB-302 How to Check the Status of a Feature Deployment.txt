KB-302: How to Check the Status of a 
Feature Deployment 
Applicable Product: All NexaCore Microservices 
Target Audience: L1/L2 Support Agents, CSMs 
Last Updated: 2025-10-28 
Objective 
To enable Support Agents to quickly determine if a reported client issue is caused by a recent 
deployment (release) or is a genuine production bug. 
Procedure: Checking the Release Management 
Dashboard 
All features and hotfixes are deployed using the official Release Management Process. You 
can track the status using the internal NexaCore-Ops dashboard. 
Step 1: Accessing the Dashboard 
1.​ Navigate to the internal URL: https://ops.nexacore.com/releases. 
2.​ Authenticate using your standard corporate SSO credentials. 
Step 2: Locating the Relevant Release 
Locate the last major release or hotfix that occurred immediately before the client reported 
the issue. The releases are labeled by date and feature name (e.g., 
RC-2025-11-01-PAWT-Beta). 
Step 3: Checking Deployment Status 
Review the following key indicators for the release: 
Indicator 
Status Meaning 
Action for Support Agent 
Canary Deployment 
IN PROGRESS 
The feature is only active 
for a small, non-critical 
segment (). Issues are 
unlikely to affect the 
general enterprise client 
base. 

Rollout Status 
FULL ROLLOUT (100%) 
The feature is live 
everywhere. If the issue is 
related, proceed to check 
Smoke Tests. 
Smoke Test Result 
FAILED 
A core functionality check 
failed immediately 
post-deployment. The 
deployment is likely broken 
or partially rolled back. 
Action: Immediately 
escalate as a P1 incident 
(Release Failure). 
Rollback Instructions 
ACTIVE 
The previous stable version 
is being re-deployed. 
Inform the client the issue 
is temporary and 
engineering is aware. 
Key Metric for Agents: Change Failure Rate (CFR) 
If the Change Failure Rate metric on the dashboard is for the last 24 hours, treat all 
incoming tickets with increased urgency, as systemic instability is likely.
