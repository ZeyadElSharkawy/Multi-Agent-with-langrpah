Multilingual Support Guidelines 
(Arabic/English) 
Department: Customer Support (MENA Operations) 
Guideline ID: CS-GL-002 
Objective: Standardize service quality for both English and Arabic-speaking enterprise clients, 
ensuring cultural competence and technical accuracy. 
1. Language Prioritization and Triage 
1.​ Ticket Queueing: All incoming tickets are processed by a language detection model. 
They are then routed to the English Queue or the Arabic Queue. 
2.​ L1 Assignment: Only certified bilingual agents (internal certification required) are 
allowed to work the Arabic Queue. 
3.​ Technical Terminology: When responding in Arabic, use widely accepted, modern 
technical Arabic terms (e.g., بوابة واجهة برمجة التطبيقات - API Gateway or سيرفر - Server) to 
maintain clarity and professionalism. 
2. Communication Best Practices 
●​ Tone: Maintain a highly professional and formal tone in Arabic correspondence, 
reflecting the importance of enterprise communication in the region. 
●​ Translation Tools: Agents may use internal, approved translation tools (like the in-app 
Gemini Assistant) for initial understanding of complex, colloquial Arabic tickets, but all 
final outbound communication must be reviewed by a certified bilingual agent for 
accuracy and cultural nuance before sending. 
●​ Escalation: If a technically complex P1 ticket is written in Arabic, the L1 agent must 
provide a concise English Summary (including all technical details) before escalating to 
the L2/L3 Engineering team, as not all R&D staff may be fluent in technical Arabic. 
3. Knowledge Base (KB) Management 
●​ Mandate: All critical KB articles relating to SSO, Data Residency, and P1 incident 
troubleshooting must have an up-to-date Arabic translation (KB-XXX-AR). 
●​ Review Cycle: Arabic KB articles must be reviewed quarterly by the Head of Support to 
ensure linguistic and technical accuracy.
