2. Activation and Relocation Strategy (Localized 
Disaster) 
This plan is activated when the Dubai HQ is physically inaccessible or non-functional for more 

than 4 hours (e.g., major power outage, fire, natural disaster). 
1.​ Declaration: The Chief Operating Officer (COO) declares BCP Activation (Tier 1) and 
notifies all staff via SMS/Emergency Email. 
2.​ Relocation: All staff are instructed to work remotely or report to a pre-approved 
alternate work site in Dubai/Sharjah (if available). 
3.​ Critical Systems Check: Operations Team follows the BCP Activation checklist to verify 
the accessibility of all critical systems (Section 1) from the remote locations. 
3. IT Recovery Procedure (Loss of Server Room) 
If the Dubai HQ Server Room is lost: 
1.​ Networking: Switch internal DNS/DHCP services to the redundant cloud-based virtual 
networking appliance. 
2.​ File Servers: Initiate restoration of the Internal File Server snapshot to the cloud 
environment. 
3.​ User Support: IT Team immediately pivots to remote desktop support tools to assist 
employees with connectivity issues.
