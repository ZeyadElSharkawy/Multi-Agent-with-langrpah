showing initial stabilization in latency metrics. Waiting for a 15-minute stable window before 
confirming resolution. 
4. RESOLVED / RESTORED 
[HH:MM] AST: The Incident Commander has declared the service RESTORED. 
Root Cause (Tentative): [Brief description of the cause, e.g., A bug in the new rate-limiter
