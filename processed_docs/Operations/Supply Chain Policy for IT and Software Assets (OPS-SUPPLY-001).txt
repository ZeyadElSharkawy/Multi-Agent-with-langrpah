Supply Chain Policy for IT and Software 
Assets (OPS-SUPPLY-001) 
Department: Operations, Legal & Finance 
Version: 1.0 
Date: 2025-10-01 
1. Scope and Risk Management 
This policy governs the acquisition, use, and disposal of all IT hardware (servers, networking 
equipment, user devices) and third-party software/cloud licenses utilized by NexaCore. The 
primary risk mitigated is the introduction of compromised or non-compliant components. 
2. Hardware Supply Chain Security 
●​ Authorized Sourcing: All critical hardware (e.g., firewall devices, data center servers) 
must be sourced directly from approved, tier-1 manufacturers or authorized regional 
distributors. No "grey market" or unverified sources are permitted. 
●​ Tamper-Evident: Upon receipt, Operations personnel must inspect packaging for signs 
of tampering. Any suspicious package must be quarantined and reported to the IT 
Security Officer. 
●​ Secure Disposal: Hardware reaching end-of-life must be destroyed by a certified asset 
disposal vendor. Data-bearing devices (SSDs, HDDs) must undergo mandatory physical 
destruction and provide a certificate of destruction. 
3. Software Licensing and Vendor Compliance 
●​ License Management: All commercial software must be tracked in the Centralized Asset 
Management (CAM) system. Licenses must be renewed preemptively to avoid service 
interruption. 
●​ Open Source Governance: The R&D team must provide a Software Bill of Materials 
(SBOM) for all production builds. Open-source licenses must be reviewed by Legal to 
ensure compatibility with our SaaS model. 
●​ Third-Party Code Audit: For any third-party code library that handles client data or 
authentication, a basic security audit (e.g., static analysis) must be performed by R&D 
before integration. 
4. Regional Sourcing and Compliance 
●​ Vendor Vetting: Priority is given to vendors that can provide evidence of regional 
compliance and local support presence in the MENA region. 
●​ Customs and Export Control: Operations is responsible for ensuring all imported 
hardware complies with UAE and regional export/import control regulations. All 

documentation must be retained for years.
