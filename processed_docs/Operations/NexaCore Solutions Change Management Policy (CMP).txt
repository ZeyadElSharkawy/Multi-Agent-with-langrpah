Management Policy (CMP) 
Department: Operations (Governed by Change Advisory Board - CAB) 
Version: 3.0 
Date: 2025-10-01 
1. Policy Overview 
This policy defines the process for managing all changes to the NexaCore production 
environment, infrastructure, and core business systems. The goal is to minimize risk, reduce 
service disruptions, and ensure the integrity of our AI-driven automation platform. 
2. Definitions 
●​ Change: Any modification, addition, or removal of hardware, software, documentation, or 
procedure that could affect IT services. 
●​ Change Request (CR): The formal documentation of a proposed change. 
●​ Change Advisory Board (CAB): A cross-functional group (Ops, R&D, Security, Product) 
responsible for reviewing and approving high-risk changes. 
●​ Change Freeze: A period where non-critical changes are suspended (e.g., during major 
product launches or peak season).

4. Normal Change Request Workflow (7 Steps) 
1.​ Submission: Submitter creates a detailed CR, including: Scope, Business Justification, 
Detailed Implementation Plan, Backout Plan, and Expected Impact. 
2.​ Assessment: CR is evaluated for risk (Likelihood x Impact) by the Ops team. 
3.​ CAB Review: The CR is presented at the weekly CAB meeting. The CAB either Approves, 
Rejects, or Defers the change. 
4.​ Scheduling: Approved changes are scheduled for the next appropriate Change 
Window (Standard Window: Tuesday/Wednesday, 01:00 - 05:00 AST). 
5.​ Implementation: Change is executed strictly following the Implementation Plan. 
6.​ Verification: Post-implementation checks are executed to confirm service function and 
stability. 
7.​ Closure: CR is closed with documentation of success or failure. 
5. Backout Planning 
Every Normal and Emergency change MUST include a documented, tested Backout Plan. 
The backout plan must restore service to the state immediately preceding the change. The 
estimated time to execute the backout plan (MTTB) must be less than the expected MTTR for 
the change's highest potential failure impact.
