3. The 5-Step Procurement Workflow 
Step 1: Need Identification & Initiation 
●​ Initiator: Submits a detailed Purchase Request (PR) via the internal ERP system. The PR 
must include: business justification, required specifications, estimated budget, and 
proposed vendor(s) (if known). 
●​ Documentation: For software licenses, the PR must specify the intended use case and 
the expected volume of data processing (critical for cloud cost management). 
Step 2: Vendor Sourcing and Selection 
●​ Sourcing: The Operations Team assists the initiating department in identifying potential 
vendors. For Tier 3 and 4, a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) must be issued. 
●​ Evaluation: All new vendors must complete the Vendor Evaluation Form. Selection is 
based on cost, delivery time, quality, security compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001), and 
regional presence. 
Step 3: Contract Negotiation & Legal Review 
●​ Negotiation: Focus on price, service level agreements (SLAs), termination clauses, and 
data residency clauses (ensuring compliance with MENA regulations). 
●​ Legal: All Tier 3 and 4 contracts MUST be reviewed by the Legal & Compliance 
Department before signing. 
Step 4: Approval and Purchase Order (PO) Issuance 
●​ Once legal review is complete and necessary signatures are obtained (as per the 
Approval Matrix), the Finance Department issues a formal Purchase Order (PO) to the 
selected vendor. 
●​ Budget Check: Finance confirms available budget allocation. No work may commence or 
goods be delivered without a valid PO. 
Step 5: Goods Receipt and Payment 
●​ Receipt: For physical goods (e.g., networking hardware), the Operations Team confirms 
receipt and verifies it against the PO and specifications. For cloud services, Ops confirms 
successful resource provisioning. 
●​ Invoicing: Vendor submits the invoice referencing the valid PO number. Finance 
processes payment according to the Vendor Payment Policy (standard Net 30 days).
