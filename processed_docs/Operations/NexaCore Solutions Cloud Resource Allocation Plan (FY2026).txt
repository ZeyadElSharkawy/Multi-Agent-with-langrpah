NexaCore Solutions: Cloud Resource 
Allocation Plan (FY2026) 
Department: Operations (SRE/Infrastructure Team) 
Plan Owner: [Head of Operations] 
Date: 2025-09-15 
1. Executive Summary 
This plan outlines the resource allocation strategy for the upcoming fiscal year, focusing on 
controlling cloud expenditure while meeting the scaling demands of our target enterprise 
clients. The primary strategy is shifting from on-demand compute to a blended model utilizing 
Reserved Instances (RIs) and Spot Instances where appropriate, with a target 3-year cost 
saving of 18%. 
2. Allocation Principles 
1.​ Cost Centrality: Every service must be tagged with a Cost Center (e.g., cc-RND, 
cc-Prod, cc-Ops). 
2.​ Rightsizing: Quarterly review of all non-production resources to ensure they are 
appropriately sized for the workload (e.g., moving underutilized QA environments to 
smaller instance types). 
3.​ Automation: Prioritize Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via Terraform for predictable, 
repeatable provisioning and de-provisioning, particularly for ephemeral testing 
environments.

increased AI model training requirements. 
4. Scaling Strategy for Client Growth 
To manage unpredictable enterprise client growth, we will utilize a two-tier scaling strategy: 
Tier 1: Auto-Scaling & Vertical Scaling 
●​ All customer-facing microservices within the K8s clusters will utilize horizontal Pod 
Autoscalers (HPA) based on CPU/Memory utilization, maintaining a target utilization of 
65%. 
●​ Database clusters (e.g., PostgreSQL RDS) will be configured for automated vertical 
scaling (Storage) and read replicas (Horizontal scaling). 
Tier 2: Pre-Commitment (Reserved Instances) 
●​ Target Coverage: Aim to cover 75% of the expected base load (calculated from FY2025 
usage + forecasted small client base) with 1-year or 3-year Reserved Instances (RIs). This 
provides immediate guaranteed capacity at a discounted rate. 
●​ Justification: Given the long-term contracts (3-5 years) with our enterprise clients, RIs 
offer stability and significant cost savings over on-demand pricing for predictable 
workloads.
