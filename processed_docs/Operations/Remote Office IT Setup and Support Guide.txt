VPN client. 3. Reboot the 
machine. 
Performance/Slowness 
Create a P3 ticket with a

Hardware Failure 
Create a P2 ticket 
(Requires asset number). 
Contact IT immediately. We

replacement policy 
(next-day delivery in major 
MENA cities). 
4. Hardware Replacement Policy (Remote) 
1.​ Employee reports hardware failure (P2 ticket). 
2.​ IT confirms failure and initiates a replacement order. 
3.​ The logistics partner delivers the replacement hardware within 2 business days (major 
MENA cities). 
4.​ The employee must return the faulty hardware using the prepaid shipping label within 5 
business days of receiving the replacement. Failure to return the faulty asset will result in 
a deduction from the next payroll cycle.
