Operational Risk Management SOP 
(OPS-RISK-001) 
Department: Operations (Owned by COO) 
Version: 1.0 
Date: 2025-10-01 
1. Scope and Objective 
This SOP covers the identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring of non-financial 
and non-security Operational Risks that could disrupt NexaCore's ability to deliver its core 
SaaS platform or manage internal infrastructure effectively. 
2. The Risk Management Cycle 
NexaCore uses a standardized four-step cycle for continuous risk management: 
Step 1: Identification 
●​ Method: Quarterly Risk Workshops, Post-Mortems, and Departmental Audits. 
●​ Documentation: All risks must be logged in the Operational Risk Register with a 
unique ID (e.g., OPRISK-042). 
Step 2: Assessment (Impact vs. Likelihood) 
Risks are scored on a scale of 1 to 5 for both Likelihood (1=Rare, 5=Almost Certain) and 
Impact (1=Minor, 5=Catastrophic). 
Total Score (L x I) 
Risk Level 
Required Action 
15 – 25 
Extreme (Red) 
Immediate action required. 
Must be monitored weekly 
by Executive Team. 
8 – 14 
High (Amber) 
Mitigation plan must be 
assigned and actively 
managed quarterly. 
4 – 7 
Moderate (Yellow) 
Mitigation plan defined; 
monitored biannually. 
1 – 3 
Low (Green) 
Accept and monitor. 

Step 3: Mitigation Strategy (The 4 T's) 
For all Extreme and High risks, one of the following mitigation strategies must be defined: 
1.​ Tolerate (Accept): The risk is low or mitigation cost outweighs the potential impact. 
2.​ Treat (Mitigate): Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact (e.g., implement 
redundant ISP connections). 
3.​ Transfer (Insure): Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., cyber insurance, outsourcing 
non-core functions). 
4.​ Terminate (Avoid): Stop the activity that generates the risk (e.g., discontinuing support 
for an outdated, high-risk library). 
Step 4: Monitoring and Review 
The Operations Team reviews the top 10 risks in the Register during the Monthly Operations 
Review meeting. Owners must provide a status update on their assigned mitigation tasks.
