3. Optimization Opportunities & Actions Taken 
3.1 Rightsizing (Compute/Database) 
●​ Finding: [X number] of non-production EC2 instances are running at CPU utilization. 
●​ Action Taken: Downsized to smaller instance family, saving $[Amount] monthly. 
●​ Next Action: Target R&D development environments for automated shut-down after 
19:00 AST. 
3.2 Storage Clean-Up 
●​ Finding: [X number] of unattached or aged ( days) EBS volumes and S3 buckets 
identified. 
●​ Action Taken: Deleted/Archived unused resources, saving $[Amount] monthly. 
●​ Next Action: Enforce a 60-day lifecycle policy on all non-prod S3 buckets. 
3.3 Reserved Instance (RI) and Savings Plan Efficiency 
●​ Current RI Coverage: [Percentage] 
●​ Gap/Recommendation: Purchase an additional $[Amount] in 1-year RIs to cover 
projected base load growth in the core data lake, increasing coverage to . 
●​ Estimated Savings from Purchase: $[Amount] annually.
