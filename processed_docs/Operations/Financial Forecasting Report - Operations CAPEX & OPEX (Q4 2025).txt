3. Mitigation Strategy (High OPEX) 
The forecasted increase in cloud spend is a risk. We must focus on the following to prevent 
further cost escalation: 
1.​ Action: Expedite the purchase of $[Amount] in Reserved Instances (RIs) in October to 
lock in discounted rates for predictable loads. 
2.​ Action: Dedicate 10 hours per week of SRE time to automated resource rightsizing 
across non-production environments. 
Conclusion: The Q4 increase in OPEX is manageable, primarily driven by core business 
scaling. The planned CAPEX for the KSA office is necessary for regional growth.
