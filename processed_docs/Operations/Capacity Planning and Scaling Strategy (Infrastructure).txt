Capacity Planning and Scaling Strategy 
(Infrastructure) 
Department: Operations (SRE Team) 
Plan ID: CAP-STRAT-2025Q4 
Review Date: Quarterly 
1. Core Principles 
NexaCore's capacity strategy is built on preemptive scaling to handle the high-volume 
transactional loads typical of enterprise automation, while mitigating the risk of resource 
exhaustion or performance degradation. 
1.​ Predictive Analysis: Base capacity planning on 12-month trailing client growth data and 
6-month product adoption forecasts (e.g., predicted workflow count per client). 
2.​ Headroom Buffer: Maintain a minimum of 20% spare capacity (Headroom) across the 
cluster before triggering an alert for manual intervention or purchasing Reserved 
Instances. 
3.​ Client Tiering: Capacity for high-tier enterprise clients (Tier 1) is guaranteed and 
monitored separately from the general pool. 
2. Key Metrics for Capacity Monitoring 
Metric 
Threshold/Alert 
Action Required 
Cluster CPU Utilization 
(Avg.) 
 for 30 minutes 
Trigger Capacity Alert 
(P2). Review autoscaling 
configuration. 
Database Connection 
Pool Usage 
 for 10 minutes 
Trigger Performance Alert 
(P1/P2). Review query 
efficiency and connection 
limits. 
Disk IOPS/Throughput 
 of provisioned limit 
Trigger Degradation Alert 
(P1). Immediately provision 
higher IOPS storage. 
AI Model Inference 
Latency 
 (P95) 
Trigger Performance Alert 
(P1). Scale up inference 
microservice workers. 

3. Scaling Mechanisms 
Mechanism 
Trigger 
Response Time 
Description 
Horizontal Pod 
Autoscaling (HPA) 
CPU/Memory 
utilization above 
(Container Level) 
Instantaneous 
(Seconds) 
Automatically adds 
or removes 
application pods 
within the cluster. 
Cluster 
Autoscaling (CA) 
Cluster node 
utilization above 
(Node Level) 
Fast (Minutes) 
Adds new virtual 
machine nodes to 
the Kubernetes 
cluster to 
accommodate new 
pods. 
Pre-Scheduled 
Scaling 
Known events (e.g., 
weekly data 
ingestion ETL job, 
major marketing 
campaign load) 
Pre-configured 
Manually increase 
cluster size 1 hour 
prior to the event 
and scale down 
afterwards. 
Reserved 
Instance Purchase 
Predictive planning

capacity exceeding

capacity. 
4. Capacity Review Workflow
