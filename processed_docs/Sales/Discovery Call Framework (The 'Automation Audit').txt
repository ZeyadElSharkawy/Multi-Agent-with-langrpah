Discovery Call Framework (The 
'Automation Audit') 
Document ID: SAL-DCF-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: Sales Enablement 
Call Objective: Challenge the Status Quo and Quantify 
the Problem 
Phase 1: Context & Upfront Contract (5 min) 
●​ Goal: Set the agenda, secure permission to ask tough questions, and confirm the time 
limit. 
●​ Script Opener: "Thank you for the time. By the end of this 30 minutes, we aim to confirm 
if your [Problem Area] is critical enough for an automation solution. I'll ask about 
budgets, current risks, and who else needs to weigh in. Does that sound fair?" 
Phase 2: Pain & Process Deep Dive (15 min) 
●​ Challenge Questioning (The "Teach"): "We've noticed that companies in the [Client 
Industry] typically spend X hours a week manually reconciling data, which exposes them 
to Y compliance fines. Is this true for you, or is your process unique?" 
●​ Quantification (The "Need"): 
○​ Scale: "How many data points/transactions run through this workflow daily?" 
○​ Cost: "What is the fully burdened cost of the team that handles this data? What is the 
cost of a single error or mistake?" 
○​ Risk: "What is the non-financial risk if this process fails next quarter?" 
Phase 3: Budget, Authority, and Timeline (10 min) 
●​ Budget (The "Anchor"): "Given the risk you described, if we could guarantee a 20% 
efficiency improvement within 6 months, how much capital would you be prepared to 
allocate to solve this problem?" 
●​ Authority (The "Map"): "If you decided to move forward, what would the internal 
process look like? Who needs to sign off on the financial and technical commitment?" 
●​ Next Step Commitment (The "Control"): "Based on what we’ve discussed, the logical 
next step is a tailored 45-minute demo showing the precise workflow automation. Are you 
prepared to involve your Head of Data Science and Procurement team for that next 
meeting?"
