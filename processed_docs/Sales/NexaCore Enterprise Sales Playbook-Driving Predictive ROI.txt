●​ Primary Buyer Persona: VP of Operations, Head of Digital Transformation. 
●​ Critical Pain Points: High labor costs in data processing, low predictive model accuracy, 
regulatory compliance risk. 
3. Mandatory Deal Review (40%+ Stage) 
Before advancing a deal past the 40% stage in the CRM, the Account Executive (AE) must 
complete and submit the Deal Review and Approval Form to their Regional Sales Director. 
This ensures alignment on pricing, scope, and technical viability.
