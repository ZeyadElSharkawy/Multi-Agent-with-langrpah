Guide 
Document ID: SAL-DEMO-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: Sales Enablement, Engineering 
1. Objective 
To maintain a high-performance, secure, and consistent demonstration environment 
(Sandbox) that accurately reflects NexaCore's production capabilities without compromising 
data security. 
2. The Standard Demo Environment (SDE) 
●​ Access: All AEs and SDRs are granted automatic access. 
●​ Use Case: The SDE is pre-configured with the "Simulated Bank Fraud Detection" and 
"Logistics Route Optimization" workflows. 
●​ Data: Contains anonymized, synthetic, non-identifiable data only. Never upload live 
client data to the SDE. 
●​ Refreshes: The SDE is automatically reset to its base state every Saturday at 02:00 
GST to ensure performance and data consistency. Do not save custom client-specific 
data here. 
3. Custom Proof of Value (POV) Sandbox 
●​ Purpose: Used only for high-priority Enterprise deals (Stage 4+) requiring a 
client-specific pilot and model training. 
●​ Request: Requires submission and approval of the Technical Sales Support Request 
Form. 
●​ Security: Every POV Sandbox is isolated, containerized, and subject to an automatic 
90-day expiry unless extended by the VP of Sales. 
●​ Data Handling: Client data uploaded to a POV Sandbox must be handled per the Legal 
Data Privacy Policy and requires a signed Data Processing Addendum (DPA). 
4. Policy for Demo Failures 
If a demo fails due to a technical error: 
1.​ Immediately switch to a pre-approved back-up presentation (screenshot/video demo). 
2.​ Log a P1 ticket with Engineering immediately after the call. 
3.​ Do not attempt to debug the issue live on the call.
