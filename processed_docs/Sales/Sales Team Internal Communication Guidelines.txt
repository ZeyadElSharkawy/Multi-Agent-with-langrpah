3. Communication Protocol (SE Engagement) 
●​ Do Not: Ping an SE directly on Slack for client-facing support without first submitting the 
Technical Sales Support Form. 
●​ Do: Provide full context (CRM Link, Client Name, specific question) when asking for help 
on any channel. 
●​ Never: Commit the SE team to a timeline or a custom solution with a client until the SE 
has formally reviewed and signed off on the Technical Sales Support Form. 
4. Weekly Forecast Call Standards 
●​ AEs must be prepared to discuss all Stage 4+ (Negotiation) deals. 
●​ Discussion must focus on the Next Step and Risk Factors, not just the close date. 
●​ All forecast updates must be logged in the CRM before the start of the call.
