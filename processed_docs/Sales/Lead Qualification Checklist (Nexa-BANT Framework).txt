MQL to SQL Transition Guide 
This checklist must be completed by the SDR before formally passing an MQL (Marketing 
Qualified Lead) to an AE (Account Executive). All checks must be logged in the CRM notes. 
1. Fit Assessment (Is this the right company?) 
Criteria 
Status 
Notes / Verification 
Company Size 
[Y/N] 
Annual Revenue > $500M 
or Employee Count > 
1,000? 
Industry Fit 
[Y/N] 
Is the business regulated or 
does it rely on high-volume, 
repetitive data workflows? 
Geographic Fit 
[Y/N] 
Headquartered in a 
supported territory (MENA, 
APAC focus)? 
2. Nexa-BANT (Qualification Deep-Dive) 
We use an adapted BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) framework focused on AI value. 
Criteria 
Question Focus 
Minimum Requirement 
for SQL 
Budget (B) 
"Do you currently allocate 
budget to Digital 
Transformation initiatives or 
process automation?" 
A clear budget line item 
exists for 
"Software/Automation," 
even if uncommitted. 

Authority (A) 
"Who is the primary 
economic decision-maker 
for this AI project, and who 
signs the PO?" 
Access has been granted 
to the Decision Maker 
(VP/C-Level) or a clear path 
to them is defined. 
Need & Value (N) 
"If we solved [Pain Point], 
what is the annual financial 
impact on your P&L?" 
Client quantifies the pain: 
must be a high-priority, 
7-figure problem that 
NexaCore can address. 
Timeline (T) 
"When must this 
automation project be fully 
operational to meet internal 
mandates?" 
Deployment required within 
the next 6-9 months. Not 
"Someday" or "Next year." 
3. Competitor and Procurement 
Criteria 
Status 
Notes / Verification 
Current Vendor 
[Y/N] 
Is a legacy/competitor 
solution currently in place? 
(If Yes, why are they looking 
to change?) 
Procurement Process 
[Defined/Vague] 
Is the client's internal 
procurement or legal 
process mapped out? 
(Needed before Stage 3). 
SDR Certification: I verify that all criteria above have been met or addressed, and this lead is 
ready for an AE.
