Cross-sell 
Document ID: SAL-EXP-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: Sales, Customer Success 
1. Objective 
To systematically grow Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) within the installed customer base by 
maximizing adoption and identifying new value opportunities. 
2. Key Expansion Triggers 
AEs must monitor the following signals (in partnership with the CS Manager): 
Trigger Event 
Signal in the CRM/CS 
Platform 
Recommended Action 
High Utilization 
Client approaching 80% of 
their licensed API calls or 
data throughput limit. 
Propose a Tier Upgrade 
(e.g., Professional to 
Enterprise) to lock in a new 
rate before overages hit. 
Annual Renewal (D-90) 
Opportunity flagged for 
renewal in the next 90 
days. 
Initiate the Value Review, 
showing YTD ROI metrics 
and proposing a multi-year 
renewal with an added 
module. 
Internal Referral 
Successful project 
completion leads to an 
introduction to a new 
department (e.g., Finance 
introduces AE to HR). 
Initiate a new Automation 
Audit specific to the new 
department's workflows 
(Cross-sell). 
Compliance Change 
Client is facing a new 
regulatory mandate (e.g., 
new AML law). 
Propose the Compliance & 
Audit Log Module add-on 
as a rapid solution (Upsell). 

3. Upsell Strategy: Tier Upgrades 
Focus on moving clients to the next tier by emphasizing risk mitigation and predictable 
budgeting. A higher tier removes usage limits, provides a better SLA, and includes advanced 
governance features necessary for mission-critical adoption. 
4. Cross-sell Strategy: Adjacent Workflows 
Map the client's organizational chart to identify adjacent workflows that suffer from similar 
manual data problems. 
Existing Workflow 
Target Cross-sell 
Workflow 
Selling Point 
Fraud Detection (Risk) 
Predictive Credit Scoring 
(Finance) 
Leverage the existing 
security infrastructure and 
deployment model for rapid 
time-to-value. 
Logistics Forecasting (Ops) 
Production Line 
Optimization 
(Manufacturing) 
Apply the same anomaly 
detection algorithms to 
machine sensor data. 
5. Sales Approach 
The expansion sale should be positioned as a strategic business review, not a pitch. Lead 
with the success metrics achieved in the initial deployment and ask, "Where else can we 
replicate this quantifiable success?"
