Document ID: SAL-TER-2025.01 
Version: 1.0 
Effective Date: 2025-11-01 
Department: Sales Operations 
1. Objective 
To ensure equitable account distribution, minimize sales channel conflict, and provide clear 
rules for claiming and managing enterprise accounts within the MENA region. 
2. Territory Definition 
Territories are primarily defined by the following two factors, in order of priority: 
1.​ Geographic Region (Primary): The country/emirate where the client's corporate 
headquarters is physically registered (e.g., UAE - Dubai, KSA - Riyadh). 
2.​ Vertical Industry (Secondary): The client's primary sector as defined by the [Internal 
Industry Classification System] (e.g., Banking, Oil & Gas, Aviation). 
●​ Example Territory: "UAE - Financial Services" or "KSA - Petrochemicals." 
3. Account Assignment Rules 
●​ New Account Claim: The first AE/SDR to create an Opportunity in the CRM against an 
Account that meets the NexaCore ICP and follows the territory rules has the right to 
claim it for 90 days. 
●​ Expiration: If no activity (logged call, email, meeting) occurs on the Opportunity within 
90 days, the claim expires, and the account returns to the pool. 
●​ House Accounts: A defined list of global strategic accounts (e.g., Sovereign Wealth 
Funds) are managed directly by the VP of Sales and are off-limits for general assignment. 
4. Rules of Engagement (ROE) for Conflict Resolution 
1.​ Conflict Definition: A conflict occurs when two AEs/SDRs log activity on the same 
Account (under the same territory definition) within a 30-day window. 
2.​ Resolution: The AE/SDR who first created the first qualified opportunity (Stage 1+) in 
the CRM, provided they remain active, will be deemed the owner. 
3.​ Mediation: All territory disputes must be immediately escalated to the respective Sales 
Directors. If the Directors cannot resolve it within 48 hours, the VP of Sales will issue the 
final, non-appealable decision. 

5. Internal Transfer Policy 
An Account may be formally transferred between territories only with the written approval of 
both the giving and receiving Sales Directors. Commissions will be split on a prorated basis 
based on pipeline contribution metrics documented in the CRM.
