1. Executive Summary 
This forecast models three potential scenarios for NexaCore based on the success of the AI 
Workflow Suite v3.0 launch (Project Phoenix). The Base Case assumes moderate market 
penetration and sustained efficiency gains from internal automation, projecting annual 
revenue growth stabilizing around 28-30% and reaching near $120 Million ARR by the end 
of FY2028. Our core strategy remains CapEx investment in R&D to ensure technological 
leadership.

4. Sensitivity Analysis 
A key risk is the delay in regional expansion (KSA/Egypt). A six-month delay in market entry 
reduces FY2027 Base Case Revenue by $8 Million and decreases EBIT by $1.5 Million, 
primarily due to unutilized Sales & Marketing resources. 
Conclusion: The Base Case demonstrates sustainable, profitable growth while prioritizing 
strategic R&D investment.
