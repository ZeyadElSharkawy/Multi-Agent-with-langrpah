3. Action Items 
1.​ A/R: Maintain aggressive follow-up on outstanding receivables to sustain inflow trend. 
2.​ Cloud Costs: IT/Engineering to provide a detailed report on the $50k variance in 
compute costs for Q4 optimization planning. 
3.​ CapEx: Monitor Q4 CapEx pipeline (total $5M pending approval) to ensure cash liquidity 
remains above $15M threshold.
