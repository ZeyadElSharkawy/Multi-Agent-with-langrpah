1. Executive Summary 
The FY2026 budget focuses on accelerating our leadership in the AI workflow market by 
allocating 45% of total operating expense (OPEX) towards product development and 
cloud infrastructure. This is a strategic shift to stabilize our core platform scalability 
(reducing cloud costs) and fund the entry into two new regional markets (KSA and Egypt). We 
project achieving 35% Year-over-Year (YoY) revenue growth while maintaining a 15% 
EBITDA margin through automation of internal finance workflows (FinOps).
