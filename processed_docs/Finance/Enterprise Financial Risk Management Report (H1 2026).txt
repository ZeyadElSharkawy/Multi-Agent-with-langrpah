Enterprise Financial Risk Management 
Report (H1 2026) 
Document ID: FN-RMR-2026-H1 
Reporting Period: Jan 1, 2026 - June 30, 2026 
Prepared By: Risk & Compliance Team 
1. Executive Summary 
Overall financial risk remains Moderate-Low. The primary risk exposure has shifted from 
Liquidity Risk (mitigated by strong Q1 cash flow) to Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk due to 
increased sales into non-USD pegged currencies (e.g., EGP, SAR) for the expansion into Egypt 
and KSA. Technology risk is managed but remains high due to our reliance on proprietary AI 
algorithms.

3. Financial Controls Status 
●​ Compliance Audit: Q1 internal controls review showed zero material weaknesses. 
●​ Segregation of Duties (SoD): The implementation of automated two-factor 
authentication for high-value payments has successfully separated the duties of 
payment initiation and final release. 
●​ Fraud: No incidents of internal or external payment fraud reported in H1 2026. 
4. Recommendations 
1.​ Treasury: Immediately execute FX hedging for the top 5 EGP and SAR-denominated 
contracts. 
2.​ IT/Engineering: Finalize and deploy the FinOps automation tool by the end of Q3 to 
reduce cost volatility risk.
