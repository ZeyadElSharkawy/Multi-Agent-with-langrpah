2. Commentary on Performance 
Q1 exceeded budget expectations, primarily driven by early adoption of the new AI Workflow 
Suite by three major GCC regional banks, boosting subscription revenue 2.8% above target. 
The significant positive variance in Operating Income is due to strict control over Sales & 
Marketing spend (-4.9%) and effective use of vendor credit terms. R&D exceeded budget 
(+5.9%) due to accelerated hiring for the new Data Science team, which is a necessary, 
planned investment for future product differentiation.
