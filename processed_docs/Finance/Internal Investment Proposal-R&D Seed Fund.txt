1. Executive Summary 
We propose a focused internal seed investment of $3.5 Million over 18 months to develop 
"Project Phoenix," the core architecture for AI Workflow Suite v3.0. This investment is crucial 
to maintain our competitive edge against emerging global players. V3.0 will integrate 
multi-modal AI (combining text, image, and structured data analysis) into automation 
templates, unlocking a new market segment of large-scale industrial enterprise clients 
previously inaccessible with our current NLP-focused V2.0.
