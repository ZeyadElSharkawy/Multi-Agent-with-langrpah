Prototype Evaluation Report (PE-001) - 
AI Model 
Prototype Name: Sentiment Analysis for Log Routing (SALR) v0.5 
Date of Test: 2025-10-25 
R&D Lead: [Data Scientist Name] 
Purpose: Evaluate the initial performance of a new ML model intended to automatically route 
support tickets based on client log file sentiment. 
1. Technical Summary 
●​ Model Architecture: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) 
variant, fine-tuned on 10,000 NexaCore support ticket texts (Arabic/English). 
●​ Training Data: 15GB of historical, anonymized customer support interactions. 
●​ Compute: AWS p3.2xlarge GPU Instance (4 hours of training time).

3. Findings and Recommendations 
●​ Finding: The model performs well on English text ( F1), but drops significantly on mixed 
Arabic/English logs ( F1). This is a critical blocker for MENA region deployment. 
●​ Recommendation 1 (Model Improvement): R&D must source an additional 5,000 
labeled Arabic-only log entries to improve regional language feature extraction. (R&D 
Priority: High) 
●​ Recommendation 2 (Deployment: Deploy the English-only version to the US 
development sandbox for integration testing, but do not promote to production until F1 
score reaches across both languages. 
●​ Go/No-Go Decision: No-Go for production until multi-language accuracy is improved. 
Proceed to an extended Research & Prototyping phase.
