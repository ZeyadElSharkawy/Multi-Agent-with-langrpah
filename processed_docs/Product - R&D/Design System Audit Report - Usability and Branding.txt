Design System Audit Report - Usability 
and Branding 
Department: UX / R&D Front-End 
Date: 2025-11-01 
Version: 1.0 
Objective: Assess the compliance of the current production UI with the NexaCore Brand Style 
Guide and identify inconsistencies that impact usability. 
1. Executive Summary 
The audit found that while of core components (buttons, navigation bars) are compliant, 
several newly implemented R&D features (specifically the data filtering panel in the Reporting 
Dashboard) are using custom, non-compliant components. This inconsistency is creating 
significant Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) issues and cognitive load for enterprise users.

3. Usability and Consistency Issues 
Issue 3.1: Data Filter Component (Reporting) 
●​ Observation: The custom filter panel uses fixed pixel widths and does not collapse 
correctly on smaller desktop screens (causing horizontal scroll). 
●​ Impact: High usability barrier; violates the "Fully Responsive Layouts" operational 
guideline. 
●​ Recommendation: R&D must replace the custom component with the standard, 
responsive shadcn/ui dropdown and input field components. 
Issue 3.2: Iconography Inconsistency 
●​ Observation: The main navigation uses Lucide icons, but the new AI feature blocks use 
custom Phosphor icons, creating a disjointed experience. 
●​ Recommendation: Standardize all application iconography to Lucide-React by the end 
of Q1 2026.
