Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) 
Overview 
Department: R&D and Operations 
Model: Agile (Scrum/Kanban Hybrid) 
Objective: Define the standard phases and required gates for all software development 
projects within NexaCore. 
1. Phase 1: Planning & Definition 
●​ Goal: Define the Why and What. 
●​ Activities: Market research, competitive analysis, gathering stakeholder input. 
●​ Output: Product Requirements Document (PRD), signed off by the Product Manager 
and key stakeholders. 
2. Phase 2: Design & Prototyping 
●​ Goal: Define the How and create a technical blueprint. 
●​ Activities: System architecture design, database schema, API design, UX/UI mockups. 
●​ Output: Feature Specification Document, Architecture Review Document, and (for 
new technology) a Prototype Evaluation Report (PE-001). 
3. Phase 3: Implementation (Development) 
●​ Goal: Write, test, and integrate the code. 
●​ Activities: Agile Sprints (2-week cycles), daily stand-ups, code review (mandatory peer 
review for all merges), unit testing. 
●​ Gate: All code must pass automated security scanning and static analysis before 
merging to the main branch. 
4. Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance (QA) 
●​ Goal: Validate functionality, performance, and stability. 
●​ Environments: Development Integration Staging. 
●​ Activities: Regression testing, load testing (for performance-critical features), security 
penetration testing (for external-facing features). 
●​ Gate: QA Lead signs off on the Release Candidate after verifying all Acceptance Criteria 
in the PRD are met and no P1/P0 bugs remain. 
5. Phase 5: Deployment & Release 
●​ Goal: Deploy the software to the production environment. 
●​ Activities: Follow the Release Management Process, perform phased/canary 
deployments, notify stakeholders. 

●​ Gate: Change Advisory Board (CAB) approval is required for all non-standard 
production changes. 
6. Phase 6: Maintenance & Iteration 
●​ Goal: Monitor performance, fix bugs, and gather user feedback. 
●​ Activities: Monitoring SLOs, managing technical debt (using the TD framework), 
analyzing user feedback (PF-001). 
●​ Cycle: Insights gained feed directly back into Phase 1 (Planning) for the next iteration.
