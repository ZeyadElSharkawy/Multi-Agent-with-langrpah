Innovation Pipeline Document: Idea to 
Deployment (v1.1) 
Department: Product & R&D 
Objective: Standardize the process for nurturing raw ideas into commercially viable products, 
particularly those involving new AI/ML technology. 
Stage 1: Ideation (Source: Internal/External) 
●​ Goal: Capture and document all potential opportunities. 
●​ Input: Product Feedback Submission Form (PF-001), Executive Mandate, Competitive 
Analysis, Whiteboard Sessions. 
●​ Output: An entry in the Idea Backlog containing a clear problem statement and 
estimated business value. 
Stage 2: Concept Validation (Product Team Lead) 
●​ Goal: Determine technical feasibility and market demand. 
●​ Process: 
1.​ Desk Research: Product Manager investigates market size, competitor solutions, 
and pricing models. 
2.​ Tech Feasibility: R&D Lead provides a rough technical effort estimate (T-shirt 
Sizing: S, M, L, XL). 
●​ Decision Gate: Ideas must have a 'High' market demand rating and an effort estimate of 
'L' or less to proceed. 
Stage 3: Research & Prototyping (R&D Team) 
●​ Goal: Create a functional proof-of-concept (PoC) and validate core assumptions. 
●​ Process: 
1.​ PoC Build: R&D team builds a small, isolated prototype (e.g., a Jupyter Notebook or 
simple web application). 
2.​ Prototype Evaluation: Complete the Prototype Evaluation Report (PE-001) 
detailing performance, training costs, and technical risks. 
3.​ UX Sketching: UX team creates wireframes and low-fidelity mockups. 
●​ Decision Gate: PoC must demonstrate feasibility and achieve key performance metrics 
defined in PE-001. 
Stage 4: Product Definition (Product Manager) 
●​ Goal: Define the feature scope and finalize technical requirements. 
●​ Process: 
1.​ Create the full Product Requirements Document (PRD). 
2.​ Define success metrics (OKRs/KRs). 

3.​ Secure initial funding/resource allocation (Budget Proposal). 
●​ Output: Approved PRD submitted to the CAB for resource allocation. 
Stage 5: Development and Release 
●​ Process: Follow the standard Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Release 
Management Process. Includes Alpha, Closed Beta, Open Beta, and General Availability 
(GA) phases. 
●​ Metric: Track Lead Time for Innovation (LTI): Time elapsed from Stage 1 (Ideation) to 
GA release.
