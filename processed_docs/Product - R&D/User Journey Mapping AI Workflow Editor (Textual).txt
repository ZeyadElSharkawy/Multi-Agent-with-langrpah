User Journey Mapping: AI Workflow 
Editor (Textual) 
Persona: Ahmed, Workflow Manager at a large regional bank. 
Scenario: Ahmed needs to create a new workflow that automatically categorizes high-value 
transaction alerts and assigns them to the correct compliance officer. 
Phase 1: Access and Discovery (Goal: Find the AI tool) 
●​ Step: Ahmed logs into the NexaCore platform. 
●​ Thought: I know the platform can do smarter things than just 'If/Then.' Where's the 
intelligence? 
●​ Emotion: Curiosity. 
●​ Pain Point: The new AI blocks are named generically ('Classifier', 'Summerizer') and are 
not clearly marked as AI features. 
Phase 2: Workflow Creation (Goal: Integrate the AI 
model) 
●​ Step: Ahmed drags the 'Classifier' block onto the canvas. 
●​ Thought: Which model does this use? Is it secure? I need to know it's using the regional 
compliance model, not the general one. 
●​ Emotion: Slight Hesitation. 
●​ Pain Point: The model selection interface is hidden behind a secondary tab, and there is 
no visible trust/compliance badge associated with the compliance model. 
Phase 3: Configuration and Training (Goal: Set rules) 
●​ Step: Ahmed tries to configure the 'Classifier' to recognize 'High-Risk Transfer' vs. 
'Standard Transaction.' 
●​ Thought: The training data input box is confusing. Can I paste a spreadsheet here, or do 
I need to use the API? 
●​ Emotion: Frustration. 
●​ Pain Point: The UI is API-centric; it assumes the user knows how to structure the training 
payload, not how to upload simple data for quick training. 
Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (Goal: Launch the 
workflow) 
●​ Step: Ahmed runs the built-in diagnostic test. 
●​ Thought: The test says "Success," but it only ran 10 entries. I need to run 1,000 entries 
to feel safe. 

●​ Emotion: Anxiety. 
●​ Pain Point: The test environment is too simplistic; it doesn't allow testing against a 
real-world data set (e.g., last 24 hours of live transaction logs). 
Improvement Opportunity: 
Integrate a "Trust and Transparency" badge directly onto AI blocks, linked to the model's 
version and compliance certifications. Improve the Configuration UI to accept simple data 
input methods (like CSV upload) for non-technical managers.
