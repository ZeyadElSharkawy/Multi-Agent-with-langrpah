4. Key Recommendations (Product Strategy) 
1.​ Recommendation 1 (Defense): Prioritize integration efforts for [Specific Legacy ERP] 
immediately, as this is Competitor A's main differentiator. 
2.​ Recommendation 2 (Offense): Aggressively market our SLO and MENA data residency 
compliance, as this is a high-value differentiator for regional clients. 
3.​ Recommendation 3 (Pricing): Validate the perceived value of the PAWT feature to 
ensure the premium tier pricing can be maintained against Competitor B's lower 
transaction-based pricing.
