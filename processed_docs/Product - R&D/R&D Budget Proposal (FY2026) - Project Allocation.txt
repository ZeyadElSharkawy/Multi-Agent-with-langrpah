R&D Budget Proposal (FY2026) - Project 
Allocation 
Department: Product & Research and Development 
Prepared By: [Head of R&D] 
Date: 2025-10-01 
Goal: Secure $[Amount] in OPEX for R&D activities and staffing to deliver the Q1/Q2 2026 
roadmap initiatives. 
1. Executive Summary 
This budget proposal prioritizes investment in AI Model Development and Platform 
Scalability (Project Zenith) to support forecasted enterprise growth and the commercial 
launch of the Predictive AI Workflow Trigger (PAWT). We propose a increase over the 
FY2025 budget to fund 2 critical new hires.

4. Risk Assessment (Funding Shortfall) 
If the requested budget increase is not approved: 
●​ Risk: The hiring of the Data Scientist will be deferred, jeopardizing the Q1 2026 PAWT GA 
launch and subsequent AI feature roadmap. 
●​ Impact: NexaCore would lose its competitive lead in the proactive intelligence space (as 
highlighted in the Competitive Analysis). 
●​ Mitigation: The Head of R&D will re-allocate internal engineers to model training, 
increasing the risk of burnout and delaying Project Zenith.
