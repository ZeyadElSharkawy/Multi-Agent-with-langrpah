Criteria 
US-001 
High 
As an Enterprise 
Admin, I want to 
define role-based 
access to the new 
feature, so that I 
can control who 
manages sensitive 
automation 
workflows. 
Must support 
integration with 
corporate SSO 
(SAML 2.0) and 
map roles: Viewer, 
Creator, Manager. 
US-002 
Medium 
As a Workflow 
Creator, I want to 
receive an email 
notification when 
my automation 
successfully 
completes, so that I 
don't have to 
constantly check 
the dashboard. 
Email trigger must 
be configurable (on 
success, on failure, 
or both). 
US-003

As a System, I
