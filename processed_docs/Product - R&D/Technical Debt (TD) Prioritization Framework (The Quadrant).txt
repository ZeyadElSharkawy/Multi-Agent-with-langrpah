Technical Debt (TD) Prioritization 
Framework (The Quadrant) 
Department: R&D (Owned by Head of R&D) 
Objective: Provide a standardized, objective framework for R&D and Product teams to assess 
and prioritize technical debt alongside new feature development. 
1. Classification Methodology 
Technical Debt (TD) is assessed based on two core axes: Impact on the Business and Effort 
to Resolve. 
1.1 Impact on the Business (Y-Axis) 
How severely does this TD affect our ability to ship, maintain SLOs, or attract/retain clients? 
●​ High (4): Causes P0/P1 incidents, blocks critical features, or introduces major security 
risks. 
●​ Medium (2): Causes frequent P2/P3 incidents, slows down R&D velocity (slow deploys), 
or increases cloud costs. 
●​ Low (1): Only affects maintainability, documentation, or code readability. 
1.2 Effort to Resolve (X-Axis) 
●​ High (4): Requires full sprints ( weeks) of dedicated engineering time. 
●​ Medium (2): Requires full sprints ( weeks). 
●​ Low (1): Requires week of work. 
2. The Prioritization Quadrant 
The total score (Impact Effort) determines the quadrant and the required action.

this debt. 
Examples: High

Opportunistic: 
Only fix when 
working in the
