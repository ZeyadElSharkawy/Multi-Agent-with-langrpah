Notes 
True Positive 
Rate (TPR) 
 
[Result]% 
[Pass/Fail] 
Measures 
success in 
predicting an 
actual spike. 
False Positive 
Rate (FPR) 
 
[Result]% 
[Pass/Fail] 
Measures 
successful 
prediction of 
spikes that did 
not occur 
(wasted 
scaling). 
Precision 
 
[Result]% 
[Pass/Fail] 
High precision 
is required to 

avoid 
unnecessary 
system 
triggers.

3. Data Drift and Bias Check 
●​ Finding (Drift): Has the model's performance on the latest 30 days of data dropped 
below the historical average? [Y/N] 
○​ If Yes, quantify the drop: [e.g., drop in TPR due to new workflow type not present in 
the training set.] 
●​ Finding (Bias): Check for performance disparity across different client segments (e.g., 
Region A vs. Region B). [Result] 
○​ If disparity exists: [e.g., Prediction is less accurate for KSA clients due to low data 
volume.] 
4. Conclusion and Next Steps 
Overall Validation Status: [Pass / Pass with Caveats / Fail] 
Recommendation: [e.g., The model is stable and meets the PAWT Beta criteria. Proceed to 
closed beta deployment. OR: The model failed the FPR threshold; R&D must refine the 
features used for prediction and retrain.] 
Next Retrain Date: [Mandatory next date, e.g., 2026-01-15]
