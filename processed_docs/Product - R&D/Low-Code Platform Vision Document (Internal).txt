Low-Code Platform Vision Document 
(Internal) 
Project Code: LCP-2027 
Prepared By: [Product Strategy Lead] 
Date: 2025-11-01 
Goal: Define the strategic justification and high-level scope for developing a Low-Code 
Workflow Automation Platform (LCP). 
1. Strategic Imperative (The Why) 
NexaCore's current platform is designed for IT professionals. To unlock the mid-market and 
empower departmental "citizen developers" (e.g., Finance Controllers, HR Managers), we must 
lower the barrier to entry. A Low-Code Platform (LCP) will significantly expand our Total 
Addressable Market (TAM) and future-proof our platform against emerging low-code 
competitors. 
2. Target Persona and Value Proposition 
●​ Primary Persona: Citizen Developer (Non-technical Manager). 
●​ Problem: These users cannot utilize our API-centric workflow editor but need immediate, 
simple automation for repetitive, internal tasks. 
●​ Value Proposition: "Empowering departmental managers to build compliant, 
AI-enhanced automation in minutes, not weeks." 
3. High-Level Scope (The What) 
3.1 Interface 
●​ Core Feature: Drag-and-drop visual canvas for workflow construction (similar to a 
flowchart editor). 
●​ Component Library: Pre-built, non-customizable components for common tasks (e.g., 
'Email Sender', 'Data Validator', 'Approval Request'). 
3.2 AI Integration 
●​ The LCP must expose simplified versions of the core NexaCore AI blocks (e.g., 
'Categorize Text') without requiring users to define models or training data. 
●​ The LCP must enforce internal security and compliance rules automatically (e.g., blocking 
access to sensitive client databases). 
3.3 Infrastructure 
●​ LCP workflows must run on the existing core Workflow Engine to leverage current 
scaling and reliability investments. 

●​ Requires a new API layer to translate the visual workflow definition into the existing JSON 
workflow format. 
4. Financial and Timeline Outlook 
●​ Initial R&D (PoC): Q2 2026 (Focus on canvas stability and drag-and-drop feasibility). 
●​ Target Launch (MVP): Q4 2027 (Major product announcement). 
●​ Expected ROI: Opens up a new $[Amount] revenue stream from mid-market customers 
within 3 years of launch.
