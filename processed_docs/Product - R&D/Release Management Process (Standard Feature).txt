Release Management Process (Standard 
Feature) 
Department: R&D, Operations, Product, Marketing 
Version: 3.0 
Scope: Standard (non-emergency) deployment of major or minor features to the production 
environment. 
Phase 1: Planning and Approval (T-7 Days) 
1.​ Release Candidate Selection: Product Manager (PM) selects approved feature 
branches for the upcoming release train. 
2.​ Release Plan Creation: R&D Lead creates the Release Plan Document (RPD), 
including: affected services, new environment variables, necessary database migrations, 
and rollback instructions. 
3.​ CAB Review: The RPD is submitted to the Change Advisory Board (CAB) one week prior 
to deployment. 
○​ Go/No-Go: CAB provides final approval, checking for operational readiness, security 
review completion, and impact assessment. 
Phase 2: Staging and Pre-Flight Checks (T-3 Days) 
1.​ Staging Deploy: The Release Candidate is deployed to the Staging environment 
(staging.nexacore.com). 
2.​ QA Sign-off: QA Team executes mandatory regression testing and the specific feature 
test plan. The R&D Lead only proceeds with QA Sign-off confirmation. 
3.​ Operations Readiness: Operations team pre-provisions necessary resources (e.g., new 
database replicas, cloud functions) and confirms all new monitoring alerts are configured 
and firing correctly in Staging. 
Phase 3: Production Deployment (T-0 - Change 
Window) 
1.​ Notification: Operations sends an internal notification: "Production Deployment starting: 
[Feature Name]." 
2.​ Deployment (Phased): 
○​ Canary Deployment: Deploy to of the production cluster (or 1 non-critical region). 
○​ Monitor (15 minutes): Monitor key SLOs (latency, error rate). 
○​ Full Rollout: If Canary is stable, deploy to the remaining . 
3.​ Verification: Operations runs the pre-defined smoke test checklist to confirm basic 
functionality post-deployment. 
4.​ Completion: Operations sends final notification: "Deployment complete. Monitoring for 

stabilization." 
Phase 4: Post-Release Monitoring (T+0 to T+7 Days) 
1.​ Hypercare: R&D and Operations teams maintain an elevated monitoring state 
(Hypercare) for 48 hours following the release, focusing on the new feature's 
performance. 
2.​ Success Validation: Product Manager monitors the Success Metrics (KRs) defined in the 
PRD for the first week to detect any immediate negative user impact. 
3.​ Review: A mandatory Post-Release Review meeting is held (T+7 days) with Product and 
R&D to discuss lessons learned and any technical debt created.
