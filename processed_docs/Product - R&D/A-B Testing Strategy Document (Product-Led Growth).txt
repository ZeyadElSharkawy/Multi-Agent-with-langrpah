A/B Testing Strategy Document 
(Product-Led Growth) 
Department: Product, UX, & Analytics 
Objective: Standardize the methodology for running statistically significant A/B tests to 
optimize conversion and feature adoption. 
1. Core Principles 
1.​ Hypothesis-Driven: Every test must start with a clear, measurable hypothesis (e.g., 
"Changing the CTA button color to blue will increase trial sign-ups by ."). 
2.​ Statistical Significance: All tests must run until they achieve statistical significance. Do 
not end tests early. 
3.​ Tiered Risk: Tests are categorized by risk to production stability and client experience. 
High-risk tests (e.g., pricing changes, core workflow logic) require mandatory Ops 
approval. 
2. A/B Testing Workflow 
Step 1: Hypothesis Formulation 
●​ Template: "If we [change] the [element], then [metric] will [direction] because 
[reason based on research]." 
●​ Example: "If we change the initial setup wizard to include a pre-filled example 
workflow, then first-week feature adoption will increase because users will have a 
model to follow." 
Step 2: Test Setup & Calculation 
1.​ Metric Definition: Clearly define the Primary Metric (e.g., Click-Through Rate) and 
Guardrail Metrics (e.g., Overall Service Latency). 
2.​ Sample Size: Use the A/B testing calculator to determine the required sample size and 
run time to achieve statistical significance, based on expected effect size. 
○​ Note: Enterprise clients are grouped by region or segment for testing; avoid mixing 
critical client traffic in early phases. 
3.​ Test Deployment: R&D deploys the test using the feature flagging system (e.g., 
Split/LaunchDarkly). 
Step 3: Execution and Analysis 
1.​ Monitoring: Operations monitors Guardrail Metrics for P1/P2 alerts during the entire test 
duration. 
2.​ Decision: Once significance is reached, the Product Manager makes the call: 
○​ Winning Variant: Fully deploy the winning variant to of users. 
○​ Inconclusive: Stop the test and document findings. 

○​ Losing Variant: Document findings and kill the variant.
