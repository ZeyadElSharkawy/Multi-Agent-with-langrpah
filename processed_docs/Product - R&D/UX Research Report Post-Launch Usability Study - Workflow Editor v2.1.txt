UX Research Report: Post-Launch 
Usability Study - Workflow Editor v2.1 
Project: Workflow Editor Redesign (v2.1) 
Researcher: [UX Specialist Name] 
Date: 2025-09-20 
Participants: 10 Enterprise Workflow Creators (5 UAE, 5 Remote) 
1. Executive Summary 
The v2.1 Workflow Editor successfully resolved of the navigation issues identified in v2.0. The 
primary goal of reducing task completion time for the 'If/Then' Logic Block was met (a 
reduction). However, a critical usability issue emerged regarding the discovery of new AI 
blocks. 
2. Methodology 
●​ Type: Moderated, task-based usability testing (Remote via video conference). 
●​ Tasks: Participants were given 5 specific tasks, including "Create a workflow that uses 
the new sentiment analysis block to route emails." 
●​ Metrics: Task Success Rate, Time on Task, and System Usability Scale (SUS). 
3. Key Findings 
Finding 3.1: Task Success (Positive) 
●​ Result: Average Task Success Rate was (v2.0 was ). 
●​ Conclusion: The new left-side navigation panel is effective and intuitive for existing 
workflow blocks. 
Finding 3.2: AI Block Discovery (Critical Pain Point) 
●​ Observation: participants failed to find the new 'AI Content Summarization' block in 
under 60 seconds. They expected the block to be in the "Data Transformation" section, 
but it was located under the "Intelligence" section. 
●​ Impact: New AI features are effectively hidden, limiting adoption. 
●​ Recommendation: Rename the 'Intelligence' block category to 'AI & Data 
Transformation' and/or add an "AI" tag that is searchable via the editor's search bar. 
Finding 3.3: Mobile Responsiveness (Low Priority) 
●​ Observation: All users primarily use the Editor on a desktop, but 3 users attempted to 
check basic workflow status on a mobile tablet. The canvas rendering on tablet screens is 
distorted. 
●​ Recommendation: Address the mobile canvas rendering distortion for viewing 

workflows in Q1 2026. Prioritize desktop experience for editing.
