A/B Testing Strategy Document - 
Appendix: Test Deployment Guide 
Deployment Owner: R&D Front-End Engineer 
System: Internal Feature Flagging Platform (FFP) 
Objective: Provide R&D with a step-by-step guide for deploying and monitoring A/B test 
variants. 
1. Test Preparation (Before Deployment) 
1.​ Ticket Creation: Ensure the test has an approved Product ticket containing the 
Hypothesis, Primary Metric, and Target Segment (e.g., of users in the UAE region). 
2.​ Code Branching: Create separate, isolated code branches for Variant A (Control) and 
Variant B (Test). 
3.​ Feature Flagging: Define a new feature flag in the FFP (ff-AB-TEST-00X). Ensure the 
flag defaults to OFF in production. 
4.​ Logging: Implement event logging on both Variant A and Variant B for the Primary Metric 
(e.g., event.log("AB_TEST_00X_Click", "Variant_B")). 
2. Deployment Steps 
1.​ Merge: Merge both Variant A and Variant B branches to the main R&D branch. 
2.​ Staging: Deploy the code to the Staging environment. 
3.​ Smoke Test: Product Manager and R&D must verify both variants load correctly and the 
FFP correctly assigns the control/test groups based on the URL parameter. 
4.​ Production Canary: Deploy the code to Production (Feature Flag still OFF). 
5.​ Activation: Once deployed, the R&D Engineer slowly activates the feature flag based on 
the target segmentation defined in the Product ticket (e.g., segment for 1 hour, then ). 
3. Monitoring and Safety Checks 
●​ Guardrail Alerting: The SRE team must set up temporary, elevated alerts on the new 
feature endpoints to monitor for performance degradation. 
●​ Daily Check: The Product Manager and R&D Lead must review the dashboard daily to 
ensure traffic splitting is and that error rates for the test segment are not significantly 
higher than the control segment. 
●​ Kill Switch: If a P1/P0 incident is triggered by the test, the R&D Engineer must 
immediately flip the feature flag OFF in the FFP (the kill switch). The fix is then deployed 
as an emergency patch.
