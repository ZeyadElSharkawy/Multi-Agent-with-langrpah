3. Brand Tone and Voice 
Our voice is Authoritative, Transparent, and Forward-Thinking. 
●​ Do: Use clear, declarative sentences. Focus on outcomes (predictive accuracy, profit 
margin, risk reduction). Use a confident but humble tone. 
●​ Don't: Use hype, buzzwords without explanation (e.g., "truly revolutionary"), or overly 
technical jargon outside of R&D-specific content. Avoid aggressive sales language. 

4. Visual Identity (Summary) 
●​ Primary Color Palette: Deep Teal, Electric Blue, and Slate Grey. 
●​ Typography: Primary Font: Inter (Used across all digital properties). Secondary Font: 
Mono Space (for code blocks/technical specs). 
●​ Imagery: Use abstract, clean, and futuristic visualizations that represent data flow and 
network complexity, avoiding literal images of people using computers.
