1.​ Nomination: Sales or Customer Success (CS) submits a successful customer to 
Marketing (based on high usage, renewal, or strong ROI). 
2.​ Vetting & Outreach: Marketing confirms the project details and initiates a formal 

request for advocacy permission via the Sales/CS Account Owner. 
3.​ Content Creation: Marketing conducts interviews and drafts the content, securing 
review and final sign-off from the client's authorized contact. 
4.​ Publishing & Reward: Content is published. The client contact is thanked with a reward 
(e.g., [USD $500] donation to their charity or a premium gift). 
4. Legal Compliance 
A fully executed Case Study Release Form is mandatory for all Tier A content and must be 
filed with Legal before publication. All metrics used must be verifiable.
