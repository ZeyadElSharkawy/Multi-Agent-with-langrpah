Department: Marketing, HR, Legal 
1. Objective 
To provide guidelines for all corporate and employee social media activity to protect 
NexaCore's brand, intellectual property, and compliance standing. 
2. Corporate Account Guidelines 
●​ Authorized Use: Only the Corporate Marketing Team has access to and authorization to 
post on official NexaCore accounts (LinkedIn, X, etc.). 
●​ Content: Must adhere strictly to the Brand Voice Standard and avoid political or overly 
sensitive topics. 
●​ Monitoring: Corporate accounts must be monitored daily for customer service inquiries, 
negative feedback, and potential crisis signals. Response time for customer inquiries is < 
2 hours. 
3. Employee Guidelines 
●​ Personal Use: Employees are free to use personal social media but must be clear that 
their views are their own, not those of NexaCore. 
●​ Confidentiality: Employees must never share non-public information, intellectual 
property, unreleased product plans, or internal discussions. 
●​ Professionalism: Employees should refrain from engaging in public arguments, making 
discriminatory remarks, or using unprofessional language, especially when their affiliation 
with NexaCore is known. 
●​ Client Information: Discussing clients, even positively, requires explicit approval from 
the client and the Head of Communications. 
4. Handling Negative Feedback and Crisis 
Do not delete valid, non-abusive negative comments. Escalate immediately to the 
Communications lead. For potential crises, activate the Public Relations Protocol and use a 
unified, approved response only.
