1. Compliance Mandate 
All marketing data collection, processing, and storage must strictly comply with global 
regulations, including the GDPR, CCPA, and regional laws where data subjects reside. Data 
Privacy is a core priority. 
2. Consent Acquisition and Management 
●​ Explicit Consent: For all non-essential data processing (e.g., personalized marketing 
emails, third-party advertising tracking), explicit, affirmative consent must be obtained. 
Pre-checked boxes are prohibited. 
●​ Cookie Consent: Mandatory use of a robust Consent Management Platform (CMP) on 
the website to manage visitor preferences for non-essential cookies. 
●​ Proof of Consent: The date, time, method, and specific text of the consent granted must 
be logged and auditable in the CRM. 
3. Data Processing and Retention 
●​ Purpose Limitation: Data collected for marketing purposes (e.g., newsletter signup) 
must not be used for a separate, incompatible purpose (e.g., R&D model training) without 
new consent. 
●​ Retention: Marketing prospect data will be purged from the active database if there is 
no recorded activity (clicks, opens, form submission) for [24 months]. 
4. Right to Opt-Out and Be Forgotten 
Every marketing communication (email, SMS) must include a clear, one-click mechanism to 
unsubscribe. Requests for the "Right to Erasure" must be processed by the Digital Marketing 
team and confirmed within [30 calendar days].
